I’m very impressed with these animation movies, how far they’ve come. They look fantastic.</p>\n<p>I liked Coco, the movie is charming, quick-paced, and delivers a happy ending. Before watching it they told me it was sad. Well, it touches on life and dead but I think their approach works nicely. It didn’t feel sad, especially because there’s “life” after dying.</p>\n<p>I’m unfamiliar with this Mexican tradition, I hope they made it justice without straying too far from the truth and now we all know a little bit more about it.</p>\n<p>The main character is very likable, who hasn’t tried to pursue something at some point just to have other people reject the idea just because of their ideas.</p>\n<p>Recommended? Yes! It’s not a musical, in case you’re worried about too much singing. I’m surprised how well the songs work mixing English and Spanish.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Coco","title":"Coco","date":"January 10, 2021","rating":4,"type":"movie"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/movies/coco/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/movies/soul/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Soul"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/black-clover/1x10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Black Clover 1x10"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
