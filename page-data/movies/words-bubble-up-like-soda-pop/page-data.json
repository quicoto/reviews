Some pure and happy teenage love story. It has a bit of drama, of course, but it’s all good.</p>\n<p>The backgrounds are beautifully drawn, on its own style. The characters are what you expect, shy teenagers who meet by accident. Each with their own insecurities or fears, only to be overcome while getting to know each other.</p>\n<p>We have a very open ending but I want to believe that someone they end up together. We don’t know how far Cherry’s parents planned to move, hopefully not across the country. Maybe Cherry stayed back and finished his studies there? Anything is possible with the power of love.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIiVp3poe2c\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIiVp3poe2c</a></p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop","title":"Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop","date":"August 09, 2021","rating":4,"type":"movie"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/movies/words-bubble-up-like-soda-pop/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/86-eighty-six/1x5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"86 - Eighty Six 1x5"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/rick-and-morty/5x8/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rick and Morty 5x8"}}}},
