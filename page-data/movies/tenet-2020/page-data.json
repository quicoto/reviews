Complicated, visually excellent and will leave you thinking for a while</p>\n<p>I’ve always had troubles with time travel movies, I love them but each one seems to explain the concept differently.

It’s complicated.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Tenet (2020)","title":"Tenet (2020)","date":"December 09, 2020","rating":4,"type":"movie"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/movies/tenet-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/movies/oblivion-2013/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Oblivion (2013)"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-mandalorian/2x7/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Mandalorian 2x7"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
