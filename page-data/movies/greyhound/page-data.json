Yet it’s an action-packed non-stop film.</p>\n<p>The CGI is stunning, wish I had seen this on a big screen and not at home.</p>\n<p>The ending felt without climax, a little strange. However, I felt relieved, as the character can take a break from the action. You can see it, Hanks does a good job showing how his moves and speech gets slower towards the end. Well done there.</p>\n<p>I did enjoy it, the movie was over in a blink of an eye.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Greyhound","title":"Greyhound","date":"July 10, 2020","rating":4,"type":"movie"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/movies/greyhound/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/spartacus-blood-and-sand/1x12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spartacus: Blood and Sand 1x12"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/das-boot/1x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Das Boot 1x1"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
