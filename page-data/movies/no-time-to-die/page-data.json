Classic Bond. Car chases (with the gadgets!), the girl, the spy doing his thing. Very entertaining.</p>\n<p>Then it got super long, like very long. I was about to drop it and continue the next day. I guess it’s somewhat interesting to see this more human, emotional side of 007. Still, I don’t know… I didn’t like the end. But how could’ve you done it differently? I guess dying for love it’s better than just saving the country or killing the villain. Which in this movie has a very strange role. Almost no appearance and not scary. Not super groundbreaking either, just steal government secrets to sell them for profit (?).</p>\n<p>I expected way more from the gorgeous Moneypenny or the stunning Cuban spy, a breath of fresh air. Sadly only for 10 minutes, I had really hoped she would stick around. No joy…</p>\n<p>I got a bittersweet taste after seeing it. It’s a must if you’ve been following the saga, especially with Daniel Craig.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"No Time to Die","title":"No Time to Die","date":"November 15, 2021","rating":2,"type":"movie"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/movies/no-time-to-die/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/inside-job/1x9/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Inside Job 1x9"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/foundation/1x3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Foundation 1x3"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","3274528899","4047580407"]}
