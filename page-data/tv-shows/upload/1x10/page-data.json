Ok, the concept for the show is not entirely new or groundbreaking. Black Mirror sort of did it first but I loved the twist, the twist of being able to connect via Virtual Reality with the dead on the cloud. If you consider them “dead”, that it.</p>\n<p>It was funny, and surreal, that the companies would of course charge extra for a better-looking set of pants or that you would have bandwidth caps with those living in the cloud servers.</p>\n<p>The main character acting is not earth-shattering but that’s ok. I think the special effects are rather cool for a tv show.</p>\n<p>The only thing is I feel the plot did not advance as much as I wanted. It seems they did not give it enough importance to the fact that he might’ve been murdered. Not sure how I’d feel if I know I had been killed. I suppose I would want to seek justice.</p>\n<p>UPLOAD has been renewed for a second season, looking forward. Well done Amazon.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"UPLOAD","title":"UPLOAD 1x10","date":"May 29, 2020","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/upload/1x10/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-office/3x17/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Office 3x17"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boku-no-tonari-ni-ankoku-hakaishin-ga-imasu/1x6/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boku no Tonari ni Ankoku Hakaishin ga Imasu 1x6"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","3274528899","4047580407"]}
