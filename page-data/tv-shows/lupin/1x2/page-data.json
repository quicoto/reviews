Alright, let’s see how far this rabbit hole goes.</p>\n<p>The whole getting into the prison was somewhat believable. The exodus, that was some Mission Impossible shit.</p>\n<p>How did the librarian keep a book that a random inmate gave him 25 years ago? Yeah, no. Why?</p>\n<p>The thugs at the prison stabbed him? If you stab the person who owns your money, they won’t be able to pay you back. I guess it was a calculated stabbing to let him live. Oh wait, they wanted to hang him the following night. What!?</p>\n<p>I don’t know, this episode was less realistic. Interesting, sure, but wasn’t as well thought as the first one.</p>\n<p>I’ll continue watching, see what they come up with for the next one.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Lupin","title":"Lupin 1x2","date":"January 10, 2021","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/lupin/1x2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/lupin/1x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lupin 1x1"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x181/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x181"}}}},
