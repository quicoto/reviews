We need a Nekoma spin-off so badly. Too sad we’re not getting it.</p>\n<p>All the characters are fantastic, well thought, and deep. Love the connection amongst them.</p>\n<p>Too bad I’m watching this while watching To The Top 2nd Season, which shows what happened in this match. Still, good to see.</p>\n<p>The other team is filled with a bunch of jerks lacking sportsmanship. Especially in volleyball where you have no physical contact, contrary to soccer or basketball. In these you can physically bully the opponent, you can hit him, get fouled, etc. With volleyball is just about pushing the ball to the other side of the court, it’s a sport that should have 0 verbal abuse. Why would you? Just hit the ball better to the other side, period.</p>\n<h2>Yaku, nooooo!</h2>\n<p>I hope he’s ok, he did a tremendous effort in saving the point and he’s usually a key player around their play style.</p>\n<p>Not sure what’s going to happen in the next one. Perhaps he has to sit this one out, which might fire up Lev even more. That would be cool to see.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cldup.com/qhncVIQ5YA.png\" alt=\"Haikyuu!
