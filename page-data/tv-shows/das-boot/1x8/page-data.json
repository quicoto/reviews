Yet, there was so much plot advancement. It’s no good the plot was so slow during the last episodes and then in one episode they climax everything. </p>\n<p>Until the last 10 seconds of the season, I was still waiting for Captain Hoffman to appear in his boat and court-martial all the mutineers and puts them against the wall. Captain, where are you!? Couldn’t they have had a ship or submarine found him?</p>\n<p>Oh boy, he is back. Is the second season going to be about boats or will it happen all inland? I need submarines, dude!</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Das Boot","title":"Das Boot 1x8","date":"July 13, 2020","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/das-boot/1x8/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/spartacus-vengeance/1x10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spartacus: Vengeance 1x10"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/das-boot/2x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Das Boot 2x1"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
