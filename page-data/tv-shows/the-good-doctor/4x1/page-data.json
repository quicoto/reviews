The struggle, the pain, the death…</p>\n<p>Lea is way more likable now, or at least in this episode. I like the duo Park and Shaun living together. I was surprised there were no tantrums about toilet paper and then, bam, the cabinet-filling-dispute. Park is such a good guy.</p>\n<p>Dr. Andrews’s face expression when he gets home and has to stay in the garage, very well executed. He transmitted the feeling quite well.</p>\n<p>It felt a little bit forced how Glassman and his wife were fighting. I don’t know maybe they didn’t lay it out correctly but it felt over-exaggerated from Glassman to reject her so forcibly.</p>\n<p>The last scene with, what might be, Melendez’s ghost… that was a punch below the belt. Uncalled for.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"The Good Doctor","title":"The Good Doctor 4x1","date":"November 03, 2020","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-good-doctor/4x1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x172/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x172"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x4/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x4"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
