I like how they did the little explanation at the beginning. I enjoyed the escape from reality, an hour away from the pandemic, masks, and COVID.</p>\n<p>I find very interesting the new phase our main characters are entering in. Senior residents who are meant to teach now. The whole interview process (and shadowing) was amusing.</p>\n<p>The best approach? Park, no doubt. Very pragmatic, having to work with someone no less than 80 hours a week… you better choose wisely. (side note: working eighty hours a week should be illegal).</p>\n<p>How about Dr. Lim and her evil plan? Loved the twist there. It was all part of the test.</p>\n<p>I felt very emotional to see Shaun apologize to Lea. How far he’s come! Saying he wants to hug her? C’mon, remember the first season?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cldup.com/KYomu3jI1T.png\" alt=\"Episode screenshot\"></p>","frontmatter":{"name":"The Good Doctor","title":"The Good Doctor 4x2","date":"November 17, 2020","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-good-doctor/4x2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x174/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x174"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x6/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x6"}}}},
