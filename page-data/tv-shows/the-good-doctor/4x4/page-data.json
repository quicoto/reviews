Like he’s growing a lot personally. Now he’s teaching, he’s already found his way of doing it (with the advice from others but still).</p>\n<p>The new recruits a breath of fresh air and I’m liking a lot the senior residents in their leadership position.</p>\n<h2>Morgan</h2>\n<p>I also like quite a lot how Morgan stepped out of being a surgeon and he’s doing general medicine. I respect that. But I’m guilty of finding amusing that the coldest person of the pack is not in a somewhat second tier. Important as well for sure, but feels like (from the outside) a demotion.</p>\n<h2>Moving in together</h2>\n<p>Love to see them so happy but I know this is a drama tv series. I’m scared for their future, please don’t destroy Lea and Shaun. Let us, and them, enjoy this a while longer. Give me drama for other characters. Shaun has had enough, he deserves a happy home.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"The Good Doctor","title":"The Good Doctor 4x4","date":"November 25, 2020","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-good-doctor/4x4/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x175/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x175"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x7/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x7"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","3274528899","4047580407"]}
