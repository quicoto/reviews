Coming from the crap drawings that made us all puke last week this one was pure joy to watch.</p>\n<p>Not just back to the old and great animation but everything in it in terms of story. The backstory moments from when Tanaka joined the club, the feeling that nothing’s going your way but after he kept pushing, being persistent, he eventually got it. The setpoint was epic, the drawing, the dramatic effect on the character. Hat tip to the animators, very well done.</p>\n<p>It will be hard to keep the level this good in the following episodes. This one was by far the best in this second season.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Haikyuu!!: To the Top","title":"Haikyuu!!: To the Top 2x3","date":"October 18, 2020","rating":5,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/haikyuu-to-the-top/2x3/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/major-2nd/2x22/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Major 2nd 2x22"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x2"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
