I’m very happy that we got this. Yes, sure, the beginning had its ups and downs, especially with the outsourcing of the animation to a different studio.</p>\n<p>The episode itself didn’t have much. Just some flashbacks to the previous episode and a little bit of slice-of-life which we were missing for the whole season. Seeing the boys outside the court is fun and refreshing, I like these episodes very much. This one, in particular, was ok, too many flashbacks to the match we just witnessed.</p>\n<p>A part from this one, the last few were very wholesome. It truly leaves you with a great aftertaste. Will we get another season? the long-awaited battle against Nekoma highschool? I sure hope so. It’s what we’ve been promised for a very long time. They’ve had matches but nothing as official or as important as this tournament.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Haikyuu!!: To the Top","title":"Haikyuu!!: To the Top 2x12","date":"December 23, 2020","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/haikyuu-to-the-top/2x12/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-mandalorian/2x8/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Mandalorian 2x8"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
