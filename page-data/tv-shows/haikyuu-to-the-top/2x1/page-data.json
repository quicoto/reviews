Are they going to slow things down like they did in the past? It sure looks like it. A bunch of episodes for a single match (or even the rest of the season).</p>\n<p>Loved how we saw not only the match but their rivals reactions outside the court.</p>\n<p>Cheer squad with japanese drums? Kick ass, that’s what it was.</p>\n<p>Can we talk about the cliffhanger at the end? The twins delivering the super quick combo like Hinata and Kageyama, how cool is that? How will the team react to it? Can they defend against it?\nIf you think about it their teammates are the ones who have seen this more often, maybe they’ll find a way to counter it.</p>\n<p>I missed some more Tsukishima smirk action, hope he makes a more prominent appearance in the next one.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Haikyuu!!: To the Top","title":"Haikyuu!!: To the Top 2x1","date":"October 02, 2020","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/haikyuu-to-the-top/2x1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/south-park/24x13/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"South Park 24x13"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-comey-rule/1x2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Comey Rule 1x2"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
