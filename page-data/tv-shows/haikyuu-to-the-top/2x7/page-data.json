If only this season was consistently this good.</p>\n<p>I liked Kita’s backstory. Receiving the 1 number and breaking down was quite emotional. They did it very well. I’m liking more and more these stories.</p>\n<p>Asahi being the ace he’s supposed to be saving the point, yeah dude, more of these, please!</p>\n<p>I feel bad for Nishinoya, I need him to cheer up and be himself again. Loud and dependable.</p>\n<p>Tsukushima’s answer to Hinata, was the cherry on top. Hinata’s face was hilarious. I love this back and forth between them. They share the same middle-blocker role but they’re complete opposites in personality and, obviously, height.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Haikyuu!!: To the Top","title":"Haikyuu!!: To the Top 2x7","date":"November 14, 2020","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/haikyuu-to-the-top/2x7/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/grey-s-anatomy/17x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Grey's Anatomy 17x1"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x174/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x174"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","3274528899","4047580407"]}
