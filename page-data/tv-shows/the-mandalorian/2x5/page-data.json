I haven’t seen The Clone Wars animated series but from what I can read fans liked the portrayal of Ahsoka.</p>\n<p>I had no idea, nor recollection, that beskar stopped lightsabers. So cool when Mando was fighting off Ahsoka. The beskar spear is going to play a big role towards the end of the season.</p>\n<h2>Onwards</h2>\n<p>The journey continues and I couldn’t be happier. The thought that the duo would part ways would be sad. I see it as a possible season-ending, them going separate ways. We’re 5 episodes in, with 3 more to go.</p>\n<p>I’m hoping for a nice fight between Moff Gideon and Mando, beskar vs dark lightsaber. Good vs evil. Let’s do this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cldup.com/SwWZOD_ZEt.png\" alt=\"The Mandalorian 2x5\"></p>","frontmatter":{"name":"The Mandalorian","title":"The Mandalorian 2x5","date":"November 27, 2020","rating":5,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-mandalorian/2x5/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/giri-haji/1x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Giri/Haji 1x1"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/haikyuu-riku-vs-kuu/1x2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Haikyuu!
