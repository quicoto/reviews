I have to give it a 3-star rating because of that. If the 50-minute chapter falls short don’t get me started with today’s episode. No one on Reddit seems to care about it. Sure the other Mandalorians kicked ass but don’t be such a fanboy and demand for a longer episode. Thirty minutes is not excusable for a show of this caliber!</p>\n<p>The “landing” on the water was funny and unexpected. The scene, pulling it out with the vegetation hanging from the fuselage reminded me too much of the X-wing Yoda pulled from the water in the original trilogy. It can’t be a coincidence.</p>\n<h2>It’s a trap</h2>\n<p>I liked seeing the same species as Admiral Ackbar, funny one-liners too!\nPoor Mando the ship looked like a fisherman’s boat after the deck crew “repaired it”.</p>\n<h2>Take off your helmet</h2>\n<p>When they showed the helmet question in the episode preview you knew it was going to be of importance today. And it was. I like how there’s more than meets the eye. Our Mando could have been raised by this extreme branch, more traditional (hence the no-helmet-removal rule).</p>\n<h2>My way or the highway</h2>\n<p>When she altered the deal and dropped the freaking sentence “this is the way” I thought “this is not the way”. Not very honorable of you.</p>\n<p>The four mandalorians looked like an Elite Navy SEAL team, perfectly synchronized, trained to kill with deadly accuracy. While the stormtroopers can’t keep up. They even make fun of it before the attack. The scene looked badass, evading blasters, shooting to kill, not a single scratch…</p>\n<p>Would’ve loved more.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"The Mandalorian","title":"The Mandalorian 2x3","date":"November 13, 2020","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-mandalorian/2x3/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x5"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/grey-s-anatomy/17x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Grey's Anatomy 17x1"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
