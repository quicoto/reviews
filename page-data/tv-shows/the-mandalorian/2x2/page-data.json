It looks to me it was not a random attack to mug him but rather targeted to kidnap the child. No surprise Mando kicks their ugly asses to the dust.</p>\n<p>Baby Yoda doing cute things again stealing the frog’s eggs. Cute but, c’mon dude, don’t do that.</p>\n<p>I loved how the frog engineered a contraption so its voice was translated using the android hardware. Well done!</p>\n<p>How about some dogfight? Short but yet awesome. It was super cool when without saying a word the X-Wings put their wings in attack position. I would’ve liked it if someone fired but well.</p>\n<p>Tell me, didn’t you think those spider eggs were Aliens? Face huggers? That was my first impression. They opened from the top, slimy juices inside and a sort of spider emerging from it. Then I realized, it can’t be. No way they copied this. They did not but it looks to me too close to be a coincidence.</p>\n<p>The whole spider run scene made me cringe! Oh my, I hate spiders. There were so many and they started crawling on the ship. Argh! Luckily the two X-Wing pilots decided to help.</p>\n<p>How can he fix the ship so fast? The cockpit glass was broken and lots of parts of the ship were severely damaged. I like that the ship seemed to have problems flying when they left the planet. Still, Mando had such a small toolbox. Must be a magic toolbox to be able to repair such a complex piece of machinery.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"The Mandalorian","title":"The Mandalorian 2x2","date":"November 06, 2020","rating":5,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-mandalorian/2x2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x4/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x4"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-queen-s-gambit/1x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Queen's Gambit 1x1"}}}},
