I did not know we had a double dose of Grey’s Anatomy this week.</p>\n<p>The episode is a little less intense than the first one. Great that they aired 2, we needed this one to cover what’s going on with the rest of the characters.</p>\n<h2>Altman</h2>\n<p>Screw you, Dr. Altman. How can you have the face to still work at this hospital, how dare you even try to reconcile with Dr. Hunt after what you did. The only thing she said was “it was a mistake”. No shit Sherlock… no shit…</p>\n<h2>Chief of chiefs</h2>\n<p>Well deserved, Dr. Webber. The stubborn Dr. Fox finally realized her mistakes. Looking forward to seeing Dr. Webber fulfill his new role.</p>\n<h2>Derek Shepherd</h2>\n<p>That was a hit below the belt, I was not ready for this. Will this just be a 10 seconds cameo or will we see dialog exchange? I hope for the latter.</p>\n<p>We’ve seen Meredith connect with the death. Back when she almost drowned and got in “contact” with her mother. Now it’s her dead husband?</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Grey's Anatomy","title":"Grey's Anatomy 17x2","date":"November 15, 2020","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/grey-s-anatomy/17x2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/haikyuu-to-the-top/2x7/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Haikyuu!!: To the Top 2x7"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x174/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x174"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
