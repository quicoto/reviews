It’s good they picked up where we left off.</p>\n<p>COVID themed episode, of course, same as The Good Doctor. Would it be weird if this only lasted a couple of episodes? Or will this go for the whole season as it happens in the real world?</p>\n<p>I could get on board the two scenarios. The scenario where COVID is gone from the show, so the viewers can get an escape from reality. Or the second scenario where masks, protocols, and death follow as long as the pandemic goes in the real world.</p>\n<p>It was great to see Dr. Webber back on his fit, he’s one of my favorite (if not my favorite) character.</p>\n<p>Avery and Jo? Interesting turn of events. Too bad it didn’t happen. Hope it happens, though. Shipping them hard.</p>\n<p>Hunt and Altman? Hikes. Talk about awkward. How can you possibly work together after that? I would leave the city, the country, or even the continent. I guess that’s Grey’s Anatomy for you. Drama everywhere.</p>\n<p>Good comeback with a bit of everything. What left me a little concerned was how Tom Koracick broke down. They didn’t explain exactly what happened, you can get the idea but I would’ve liked more info to understand what led to his outburst of frustration.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Grey's Anatomy","title":"Grey's Anatomy 17x1","date":"November 13, 2020","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/grey-s-anatomy/17x1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-mandalorian/2x3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Mandalorian 2x3"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/grey-s-anatomy/17x2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Grey's Anatomy 17x2"}}}},
