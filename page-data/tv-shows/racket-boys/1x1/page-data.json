Very strange because the reviews do not look that bad. They look very polarized though, some people love it, some people hate it.</p>\n<p>They say something bad happen to the show on episode 5. We’ll see. So far I’m liking it. The father (Kim Sang-Kyung) I’ve seen in another drama and played well. So far he doesn’t disappoint.</p>\n<p>The story so far it’s fresh. How can they make a badminton game look so epic? The lights, the music, the camera angles. WEll done, director.</p>\n<p>A nice breath of fresh air from the classic Korean Dramas. Not about high school or university, suicide, and love triangles.</p>\n<p>All good under the sun, let’s go.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Racket Boys","title":"Racket Boys 1x1","date":"August 19, 2021","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/racket-boys/1x1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/odd-taxi/1x10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Odd Taxi 1x10"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/racket-boys/1x2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Racket Boys 1x2"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","3274528899","4047580407"]}
