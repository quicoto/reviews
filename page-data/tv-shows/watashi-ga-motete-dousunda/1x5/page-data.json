Itâ€™s hard to tell what you would do in these situations. I want to believe it depends on how far your relationship is. If you just met, thereâ€™s no way the looks wonâ€™t affect you. On the other hand, if youâ€™re already if youâ€™ve known the person for a long time it might not affect (or would it?)</p>\n<p>In any case, I see the show is slowly moving forward. It was super funny how Nanashima and Shinomiya came up with the plan to give her fanservice if she reacher her goals ðŸ˜‚</p>\n<p>P.S. I knew Sinomiyaâ€™s voice was familiar. Looks like Matsuoka Yoshitsugu is the actor behind it and he has done the main characters for Sword Art Online and Shokugeki no Souma. Surprised to see an actor with such powerful roles and quite unforgettable roles do this supporting role here.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Watashi ga Motete Dousunda","title":"Watashi ga Motete Dousunda 1x5","date":"June 17, 2020","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/watashi-ga-motete-dousunda/1x5/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x145/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x145"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/watashi-ga-motete-dousunda/1x6/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Watashi ga Motete Dousunda 1x6"}}}},
