I did not see it coming though. You can see there was some tension between father and mother on how to raise the children… how could there be anywhere, weren’t they programmed? Or was their AI above that programming?</p>\n<p>When they said 12 embryos but we only saw 6 being born was the first, what the heck?!</p>\n<p>Second what the heck was when the dudes arrive and decide to take the kid. “Don’t look at her?” What? And bam! Their faces are off. Also, the actor from Vikings, good to see him.\nLet us take a second to remember the cocky android who said she could be easily stopped. Serves him right.</p>\n<p>She was “breaking down”, my ass. She’s a killing machine and she destroyed a ship with a 1000 human souls on board without a second thought.</p>\n<p>Did you notice the room full of kids and how she only took 5 with her?</p>\n<p>Campion (horrible name by the way) is starting not to trust her, with good reason!</p>\n<p>P.S. how about the giant monster/dinosaur/snake bones she was uncovering?
