Thatâ€™s dedication or a sign that he doesnâ€™t train hard enough if he has the energy for that.</p>\n<p>So, does 1000 cuts with a real heavy sword, nice! Respect. Once heâ€™s done the master orders him to do 500 more. Iâ€™m starting to like this master more and more ðŸ‘Œ</p>\n<p>In a blink of an eye, Tajiro has training for 6 months, all day every day. While he did the daemon is hibernating, first time weâ€™re told they can do that.</p>\n<p>Then after a year, the master tells him heâ€™s done with him, nothing will be taught. What?! Ok training all day every day for a year might be 10 years in conventional training (a few hours a week). Stillâ€¦ the master is harsh.</p>\n<h2>The cat masked man has appeared</h2>\n<p>Such a nice fight! Wooden vs steel. Of course, wood won, because itâ€™s not the weapon but the swordsman that counts.</p>\n<h2>The small wise girl</h2>\n<p>Ok, I like this girl!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Train to death, thereâ€™s nothing else you can do</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If only my students would understand that! ðŸ˜Ž</p>\n<h2>Closing words</h2>\n<p>Fantastic episode, the fights deserve a 5 out of 5. The last part is a little bit confusing, was he dreaming about the masked swordsman and the wise girl? Was he real? I donâ€™t fully get it, hopefully, it will get clarified in the next one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cldup.com/dS8KVFe7qn.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\"></p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Kimetsu no Yaiba","title":"Kimetsu no Yaiba 1x3","date":"May 22, 2021","rating":5,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/kimetsu-no-yaiba/1x3/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/stargate-sg-1/1x12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stargate SG-1 1x12"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/stargate-sg-1/1x17/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stargate SG-1 1x17"}}}},
