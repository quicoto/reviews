That night they enjoy a feast. Still, the master won’t show his face! Did he eat with his mask on?! Reveal yourself!</p>\n<h2>Cutting practice</h2>\n<p>Ah, so cool. They practiced straw with a core of bamboo to make it feel like animal/human limbs. Fantastic.</p>\n<h2>The sad truth</h2>\n<p>So the two other slayers that helped Tanjiro in the last episode were actually dead and they too were disciples of the same master. That’s sad, I wanted to see more of them.</p>\n<h2>Water surface slash!</h2>\n<p>This episode felt super short. The animation was superb in this one too. I hope they keep up the quality.</p>\n<p>So he slashed his neck, nice. Wondering if that’s the end or if perhaps it was too easy and the daemon has a trick up its sleeve.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cldup.com/zUvk-2MI2j.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\"></p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Kimetsu no Yaiba","title":"Kimetsu no Yaiba 1x4","date":"May 23, 2021","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/kimetsu-no-yaiba/1x4/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/stargate-sg-1/1x17/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stargate SG-1 1x17"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/stargate-sg-1/1x21/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stargate SG-1 1x21"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
