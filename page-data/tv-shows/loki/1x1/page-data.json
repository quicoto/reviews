I liked very much the old-style vintage setting of the TVA.</p>\n<p>Not a big fan of the character but with this first episode, I’m starting to like Loki more. You could already see a better more humane side of him. Quite the character progression for just being the first episode.</p>\n<p>Owen Wilson as a supporting character is also high caliber cast.</p>\n<h2>Time travel baby</h2>\n<p>I love a nice thought-through time travel show/movie. I guess we’ll see quite of it in this show. It’s always interesting to see how they explain timelines, destiny, changing the future, etc. In this one, I’m not super sure how they handle it. We’ve seen this device they use to tell if a timeline is branching, as well as a device to restore the timeline?</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the next one.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Loki","title":"Loki 1x1","date":"June 13, 2021","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/loki/1x1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/tokyo-revengers/1x10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tokyo Revengers 1x10"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boku-no-hero-academia/5x12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boku no Hero Academia 5x12"}}}},
