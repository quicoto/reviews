Quite the documentary, out of a movie. Speaking from a viewer who hasn’t followed any basketball, I loved it. I knew of Micheal Jordan, I knew Denis Rodman. However the information I got was a vague “there were very good”.</p>\n<p>I had never imagined how things played out, how much of a leadership figure MJ was, how much hard work he and the team around him had to put to win all those NBA championships.</p>\n<p>The documentary itself was very well done, epic. As I mentioned in past episodes, the only thing which made me a little confused was the time jumps (even if clearly stated). Perhaps if they would’ve produced in a more linear way it would’ve been boring? Not sure.</p>\n<p>Glad I watched it. Inspiring work ethics from those players that I can take with me.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"The Last Dance","title":"The Last Dance 1x10","date":"May 21, 2020","rating":5,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-last-dance/1x10/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-last-dance/1x9/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Last Dance 1x9"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/kaguya-sama-wa-kokurasetai/2x7/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai 2x7"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
