The fighting scene was poor. I guess it meant as a way to make Boruto more aware of his dad and how rough he had it back then.</p>\n<p>Boruto is still too naive and oblivious. I’m surprised they didn’t teach him more about the Leaf history or his dad’s past (when he was in his current timeline).</p>\n<p>I was also expecting a more serious reaction from Jiraiya when seeing the rasengan attack by Buruto. Like, go in full speed serious mode. He just summoned a mid-sized frog. Lost opportunity to show off there.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations","title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x131","date":"June 08, 2020","rating":2,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x131/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x130/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x130"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x132/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x132"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","3274528899","4047580407"]}
