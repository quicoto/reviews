The strange dynamic with the shady husband and the wise. Is he cheating on her with someone else or is he a crook? In any case strange that they decide to adopt to not pay any attention to her. Was it just to appear “normal” as a family?</p>\n<p>Not unexpected reaction from Beth when she realizes that big ass room is all by herself.</p>\n<p>School? Well, we all know how high school works. We found cliches with the girls that want to play the wife role and Beth who is interested in chess, and nothing else.</p>\n<p>I loved the ass-kicking in the tournament. How the two shmucks from the reception were telling her off because she’s a woman. She wins it all!</p>\n<p>I liked that man, who first approached her and lost like a gentleman. Unlike the former state champion, who even if he gave nice comments to the newspaper looked like a sore loser.</p>\n<p>Here’s my question though… Did she win because of the drugs? Could’ve she won without them? I guess we’ll find out soon enough.</p>\n<p>Great twist at the end when her new mother realizes she’s a gold mine and has a plan all laid out. She clearly has mental issues, which I could understand having such a husband. How will this move from here? Will the mother try to take advantage? I don’t think Beth dislikes the idea of just keep playing better and better people, while making some money at the same time.</p>\n<p>Now that she has bought her own chess set, she’ll be unstoppable.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"The Queen's Gambit","title":"The Queen's Gambit 1x2","date":"November 07, 2020","rating":5,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-queen-s-gambit/1x2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-queen-s-gambit/1x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Queen's Gambit 1x1"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
