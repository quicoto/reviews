The premise is quite interesting. A woman who is “not suppose” to play chess seems to be a genius. Was it the drugs or is she actually one? I want to believe the latter.</p>\n<p>The whole orphanage mood is quite depressing, thank God for the old man in the baseman. Such a depressing life. I was expecting some bullying but thankfully the other, older, girl takes her into her wing.</p>\n<p>It was ugly how she treated her after she gave her the pills for the match. Asking for more. Please learn some manners and some respect, especially after she did you a huge favor. There are not many things I hate more than disrespect.</p>\n<p>So far, I’m interested.
