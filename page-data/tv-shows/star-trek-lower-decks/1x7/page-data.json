An underrated show which will probably not get renewed. Those who are rating it so low are probably all hardcore Star Trek fans.</p>\n<p>I found “Boim me up” hilarious. Boimler is my favorite character hands down. The whole twist on The Farm, funny!</p>\n<p>The dog thing was a little bit of stretch. Funny at first but then they went too far, like flying!? Too much.</p>\n<p>For the first half of the episode I thought Mariner was not acting “dumb” but was failing to the pressure of being the first officer. Why would she do that? To not have to say “I don’t want a promotion”. It’s fine to stay in lower decks, someone has to do it. Waste of potential? Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Star Trek: Lower Decks","title":"Star Trek: Lower Decks 1x7","date":"September 17, 2020","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-lower-decks/1x7/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-god-of-high-school/1x10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The God of High School 1x10"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-god-of-high-school/1x11/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The God of High School 1x11"}}}},
