Harvey exploded in front of Louis, with valid reasons. Poor Jessica has to deal with the gunslinger, doesn’t look easy.</p>\n<p>Mike got what he deserved. He slept with Tess knowing she was married (loving her husband or not. Don’t do that man. Be a gentleman).</p>\n<p>I felt bad for Harold, I could not work a single minute in an environment as toxic as this law firm. I’ve never been to one but I hope they don’t do these verbal exchanges. It’s just too much. Harold should’ve punched Louis’ face.</p>\n<p>Such a powerful scene when Harvey gets to Louis’ office without saying a word and rips the resignation letter in half. No words are exchanged but the message got across. Well done.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Suits","title":"Suits 2x12","date":"July 30, 2020","rating":5,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/suits/2x12/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/suits/2x10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Suits 2x10"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-umbrella-academy/2x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Umbrella Academy 2x1"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","3274528899","4047580407"]}
