I haven’t seen anything from Star Trek other than Lower Decks.</p>\n<p>I gave this third season a go after reading a review saying it could potentially appeal to the newcomers. Not just the die-hard fans. So far, it’s true. Watching the first episode I did not feel I was missing out on details, I could follow along with the little knowledge I have about the Star Trek universe.</p>\n<p>I was immediately surprised by the well-produced episode, almost an hour-long full of CGI that did not look cheap.</p>\n<p>The plot is also interesting. I’ve always found time travel fascinating. Although I’m not sure the time travel topic will show again in the following episodes, I think the show will simply start from here and develop without any more time jumps.</p>\n<p>So far, I’m on board.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Star Trek: Discovery","title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x1","date":"October 18, 2020","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x170/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x170"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x2"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
