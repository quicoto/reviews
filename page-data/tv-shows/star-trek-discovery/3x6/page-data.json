The whole “you got me at the unsanctioned mission” was hilarious. They make such a good team. I like the plot is thickening with Georgiou’s flashbacks. The last one was scary but I wasn’t fearing for Micheal’s life.</p>\n<p>You can clearly see how Micheal has now ideals beyond Starfleet, how she’s clearly in love with Book and will go to the end of the universe to save him. I feel bad for Saru, he was put in a difficult position. Being the captain or team lead is never easy. He made the right decision demoting Michael.</p>\n<p>Can we all appreciate the sweet moment between Stamets and Adira when she explains she can talk to her dead boyfriend? This is Star Trek, anything is possible and I like how he phrased and emphasized.</p>\n<p>I’m glad Book is back, I hope he’s here to stay. Will he stay?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cldup.com/nZ5XTQ2CrK.png\" alt=\"Star Trek: Discovery 3x6\"></p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Star Trek: Discovery","title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x6","date":"November 19, 2020","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x6/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-good-doctor/4x2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Good Doctor 4x2"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
