Glad to see their search was successful in finding HQ.</p>\n<h2>Admiral</h2>\n<p>I think the admiral does a good job at being skeptical, he can’t trust them right away. They shouldn’t be so surprised he doesn’t. He eventually comes around, as we suspected he would.</p>\n<h2>Nerd alert</h2>\n<p>Love when they start saying sci-fi words, when they got to the HQ and saw all the new tech advancements. They couldn’t contain their excitement. Will they upgrade Discovery with some of the new tech?</p>\n<h2>For Starfleet</h2>\n<p>I found it funny that when they left the officer in the seed ship they departed instantly. No one questioned why isn’t she beaming up, just hit the road.</p>\n<h2>The burn</h2>\n<p>At first I was a little disappointed they knew practically nothing about “the burn” but I guess this will be used as a story vehicle to keep searching for the truth.</p>\n<h2>Book is back, baby</h2>\n<p>How about the preview? Book is finally back! Long time no see.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Star Trek: Discovery","title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x5","date":"November 12, 2020","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x5/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/boruto-naruto-next-generations/1x173/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Boruto - Naruto Next Generations 1x173"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-mandalorian/2x3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Mandalorian 2x3"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
