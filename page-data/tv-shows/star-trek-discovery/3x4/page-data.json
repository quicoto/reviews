I liked the connection between the crew, the effort the Captain is doing the pull them together showing leadership.</p>\n<p>How about when Micheal shots the Trills that are trying to attack Adira? That was funny “not Federation protocol” they say. I like it, less talking more shooting. In the lines of that Georgiou would do, she didn’t say much in this episode but I loved every bit.</p>\n<p>I miss the dynamic between Micheal and Book, I hope he comes back soon. In the next episode preview I didn’t see him, so at least one more without him.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Star Trek: Discovery","title":"Star Trek: Discovery 3x4","date":"November 05, 2020","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/star-trek-discovery/3x4/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-good-doctor/4x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Good Doctor 4x1"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-mandalorian/2x2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Mandalorian 2x2"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
