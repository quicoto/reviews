They wanted to give us a picture of unity and better communication at the club. No need for constant verbal stabbing.</p>\n<p>Totsuka priceless as usual, defeating all enemies with his cuteness. I need him for season 2, please!</p>\n<p>Overall not a bad anime. Atypical, which is good but on the other side it made me hate some of the characters in a few episodes. I am not sure if the characters have evolved much. Their relationship? Sure. Now maybe they could even be called friends but have they learned anything? Will they change their stupid pride and rotten view of the world? Unlikely from what I’ve watched.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru","title":"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru 1x13","date":"June 29, 2020","rating":3,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/yahari-ore-no-seishun-love-come-wa-machigatteiru/1x13/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/yahari-ore-no-seishun-love-come-wa-machigatteiru-zoku/1x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru Zoku 1x1"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/yahari-ore-no-seishun-love-come-wa-machigatteiru-zoku/1x3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru Zoku 1x3"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
