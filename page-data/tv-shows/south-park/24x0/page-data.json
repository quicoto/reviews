Content and length-wise, an almost 50-minute pandemic special.</p>\n<p>I love it when Randy is the center of the episode, such a character. The episode had everything, police brutality, face diapers, the POTUS, Zoom school classes…</p>\n<p>The only thing that it has not been great in the past seasons is how Kenny McCormick has had any lines. No much action from this character and I love the dude. He’s great. Stan and Kyle, yeah, they’re cool too but they’re on the spotlight too much. Not unexpectedly Cartman found a way to cheat the system. The picture in front of the camera is a classic, a classic that actually works.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"South Park","title":"South Park 24x0","date":"October 01, 2020","rating":4,"type":"series"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tv-shows/south-park/24x0/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tv-shows/the-comey-rule/1x1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Comey Rule 1x1"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["160965972","4047580407","722703683"]}
