Rick is an ass***e, he needs to be always right, to always have the last word. Poor Morty just has to live with it (he doesn't seem to want to walk out either).

I liked that the episode had no meta references, like the previous ones. Breaking the forth wall is fun but needed to be toned down a little.

Also Jerry being Jerry clicking the wrong button 🤦🏻‍♂️
