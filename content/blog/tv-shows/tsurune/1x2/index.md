Man, this animation is beautiful. They got me when it seemed the archer in the temple was actually dead 😁 I fell for it.

The story of how he started having "target panic" could've been better, or maybe we haven't seen it entirely. It feels like championship pressure shouldn't be enough to detroy your technique. Worse case you wouldn't compete again. Then again, is Kyudo about competition? I don't think so.
