Beautiful finale, there was tension yes but the whole animation, the colors, the music... such a climax to end the tournament. A happy ending all around.

I couldn't help but smirk at one of the twins, he might have target panic. Is it too harsh to say well deserved?

I liked how at the end they showed, as I understood it, the man who shot the arrow that captivated Minato was the coach's grandfather. Nice way to close the circle.
