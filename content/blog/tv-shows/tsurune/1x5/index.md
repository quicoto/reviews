And like that the team has now bonded. Being a Haidong Gumdo (korean way of the sword) instructor I can relate to what they're doing. However I don't think I could practise this, all the protocol that comes before actually firing the arrow. I guess firing is the last thing to worry about? Still, this martial art seem to have so much pre-work until you get the arrow in.
