Intense first episode. Lots of things going on.

I appreciate them switching to Japanese instead of forcing the voice actors to go with English.

So many things to discuss... The blond dude is the actual con artist, from the very beginning. They make you think the old man is like an old partner of his (could very well be) but everybody from the old man, to the woman at the house conned Makoto. To what purpose, we don't know yet.

The visual art is very interesting, not conventional.

Would recommend and will keep watching.
