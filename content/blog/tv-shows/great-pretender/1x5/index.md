A con inside a con, the whole show is a con.

Poor Makoto got played real good, not once but twice. A little bit of a stretch if you ask me. First hard to believe they could impersonate the FBI agents, hard to believe Makoto could make use of those machines he hadn't seen before...

Now he's back in Japan with a bag full of cash, which he could transport via commercial flight?

I'll keep watching but this is borderline surreal. I would like a little bit more realism.
