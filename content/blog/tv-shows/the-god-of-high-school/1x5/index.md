The show turned very dark for a moment. The death of a best friend, a  teenager best friend. Unfair and sad. Luckily the last words cheered him up.

Jin has proven to be the strongest. I liked very much the fight with the Korean (or Chinese) mystic animals. The white tiger, the blue dragon... present also in Korean culture, as well as martial arts including, Haidong Gumdo, the one I teach. Each animal with its meaning.
