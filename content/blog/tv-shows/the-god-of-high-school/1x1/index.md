I was going to give it a 5 star.

Great animation
Happens in South Korea

Then I realized they speak Japanese even though they're all in Seoul (South Korea), and secondly, it bothered me that the referee for the match had an unrealistic nose. All other characters, people in the background, seems to be normal. Yeah, I know how animes eyes look like, or the hair. But that big fake nose threw me off. Why do that if all others look real?
