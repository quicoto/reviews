I'm very confused. I didn't know this show was called Dragon Ball.

They went overboard with the superpowers, superpowers that they don't even explain. Looks like they just get full of emotions and suddenly become 10 times as strong.

Don't forget to throw in some Naruto with the 9 tails. Why not!? I understand it might be Asian mythology but wasn't there anything different than the nine-tailed fox?

Are you enjoying Dragon Ball in 2020?
