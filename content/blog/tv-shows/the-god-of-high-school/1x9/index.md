We got ourselves The Matrix scene with Neo and Smith's clones but in Japanese animation...

The powers are boring me. They make no sense. How did Mira awaken hers? By losing? By being in trance?

How about the main storyline? We get glimpses of that church with zero explanations. What is the tournament even for? To find strong players? To gather the forces of evil in 1 place?

They should focus more on the fighting and less on the super power BS.
