Oh no, the poor announcer. They showed us his, we assume, child and wife to then kill him at the end of the episode. Not cool dude!

The commissioner killed? Couldn't care less. They are shady assholes anyway.

Jin continues to show he's good and pure to his core and has ulterior motive to participate in the tournament.
