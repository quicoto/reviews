I'm giving this episode a 2 because of the animation but plot-wise is one of the worst stories I've ever seen. Ok, maybe not the story but the lack of information? Were we supposed to read a novel or something before watching this? There are so many parts left unexplained that you just have to "roll with it".

Would I recommend this anime? No. Not even for the fights. It's a shame because it started so well.
