I need their relationship to move faster! Or else we'll get to the end of the season without much action. 

Love to see the other two (Hanako and Tarou), I can feel way more love in them than the main characters.

Ah! And the brother, Naoya is a breath of fresh air. Too cute. In any other anime he'd have the girls on a queue waiting for him.
