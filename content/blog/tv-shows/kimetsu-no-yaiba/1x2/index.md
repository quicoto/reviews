A talking head! That's new. Still, the main character has the most positive attitude.

I shouldn't be surprised she can make herself young and old. These daemons are something else.

## The Master has appeared!

Nothing like starting a Master-student relationship with a face slap and a test.

Great animation while running down the hill.
