7 days have passed super fast and Tanjiro has become super good all at once. He already kills them almost without looking.

Unfortunately in this episode there were no fights so we could enjoy the animation.

I would have liked to travel to Korea to choose the steel for my sword, I guess this is only in anime 😁

## I like this kid!

He only said 2 phrases but I'm already a fan 💯
