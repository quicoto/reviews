Of course, the super dependable big brother who takes care of everyone. Cliché much?

Wait the dude has a special nose? Is he a dog? 

I love how the old man invited him to spend the night and gave him dinner. Only in ancient Japan.

Little did the big brother knew how his family would be slaughtered during the night. That was heavy.

Wait, wasn't that enough?! Now the sister has become a demon. The dude is having a rough day.

The cool-looking demon slayer has appeared and he quickly got super triggered when the main character begged for her sister's life.

Overall nice animation, great backgrounds.
