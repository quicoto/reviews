## The master returns

He's back and he's proud of the kid. That night they enjoy a feast. Still, the master won't show his face! Did he eat with his mask on?! Reveal yourself!

## Cutting practice

Ah, so cool. They practiced straw with a core of bamboo to make it feel like animal/human limbs. Fantastic.

## The sad truth

So the two other slayers that helped Tanjiro in the last episode were actually dead and they too were disciples of the same master. That's sad, I wanted to see more of them.

## Water surface slash!

This episode felt super short. The animation was superb in this one too.	I hope they keep up the quality.

So he slashed his neck, nice. Wondering if that's the end or if perhaps it was too easy and the daemon has a trick up its sleeve.
