I have to say she's way to overpowered. Alright, flying I understand, the instant-killing feature maybe... but the "go to sleep" or the instant healing? That seems a little bit too excessive. Plausible but maybe too much.

These Sol fanatics are too much. A cult of blind fools, thankfully the leader is now gone. He found Sol alright. We can only hope they'll approach the androids in the next episode, and even perhaps engage in battle now that they'll be lead by the captain.

As a closing note, I should say Campion was very annoying this episode.
