I like that they slowed the pace a little bit. The simulation on the ark was a fantastic touch. Although not sure if made the best sense. The kids, around 10 or 15 years old spent around 13 years in the simulation. That would put them from 20 to 30 years old in "lived" years. Perhaps they should've behaved more maturely. They looked a little bit too childish to me.

Father getting so easily tricked, poor fella. The one guy here and they take advantage of him.

Did you see how they were carrying on a shoulder chair the highest "ranking officer" when crossing the dessert at the end? What's this the Chinese empire or feudal Japan?

It also surprises me that after 13 years in the simulation Caleb is having a hard time coming up with names, excuses, and such. You would think he would've had the chance to learn a thing or two about the man he's impersonating.

Good episode all and all. For now, I can't see how the soldiers could fight off the necromancer. She's too overpowered.
