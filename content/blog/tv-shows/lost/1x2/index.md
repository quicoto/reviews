Not bad but I do wonder if this show is one of those were they keep creating questions without giving any answer.

This episode they've introduced more questions:

- Who is the one on that transmission?
- What happened to her?
- Why was Kate in handcuffs?
- Why is the Korean dude suddenly helping them if he told his wife to don't meddle with the rest? Why is he abusing her supposed wife?
- How on earth is there a polar bear in a tropical island?
- What's the other bigger creature they haven't shown us but the characters are sure that exist?
