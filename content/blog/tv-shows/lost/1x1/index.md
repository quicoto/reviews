Blood, desperation, known actors... I never got around to start watching this show. I remember how everyone used to talk about it and I don't know why, never really appealed to me.

Could be the known actors I recognized in this first episode became famous because of lost?

So far the plot seems pretty average. We've seen many movies of stranded people on a desert island. However, there seem to be dinosaurs? Or another weird creature that even though it seems it can move trees, doesn't seem to be able to chew a human body? (the pilot)

It was funny when Jack was recollecting the moment on the plane were he tells the woman next to him "it's going to be fine" and then the plane breaks in half.
