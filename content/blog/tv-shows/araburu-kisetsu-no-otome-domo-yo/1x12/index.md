I binged watched this one after seeing a scene on Reddit.

Not super interested in all the girls angle, the talks in the book room, the writings... on the other hand I was super invested in the two dudes. I wanted to have a happy series ending. They mustered the courage and it paid off. I appreciate seeing the fast forward, seeing both couples still together.

Now I need a similar anime from the boys perspective. Any recommendation?
