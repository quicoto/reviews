I hope Seri-kun can muster the courage to tell her he likes her. He has enough on his hands with those 4 (with the new samurai appearing this episode).

It doesn't feel like show for kids or youngsters when you put there a masochist. Hope they dial it down a little.

It's so funny when he acts like a cat. Which reminds me, I want to adopt a cat so bad... I need to finish remodeling my apartment first.
