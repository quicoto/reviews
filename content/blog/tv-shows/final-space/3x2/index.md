What an improvement from the first episode! Thank you!

I think they stretched a little too long the Nightfall reveal as the viewers already got the reference.

Loved the appearance of multiple KVNs and the pain on Gary's face, his worst nightmare indeed 😂

HUE back to the AI, a good refreshing change I was getting a little tired of the little robot. Indeed he's far more powerful inside a ship than limping around.

Galaxy 2, here we go.
