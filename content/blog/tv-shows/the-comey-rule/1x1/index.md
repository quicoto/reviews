Very insightful, I hope it's as accurate as possible.

I had somewhat followed this issue back when it happened. Even in Europe you couldn't help but get news on how the election was going.

I remember waking up the morning (Barcelona time) of the results and while having my oatmeal I went online to check who had won. I didn't believe it either.
That same day I had a meeting in which we had a colleague from the USA, he couldn't believe it either.

I'm a big fan of Jeff Daniels since The Newsroom, a very well-rounded actor that delivers here.

I can tell you this was engaging because even though the first episode goes for 1.5 hours it didn't seem long. I thought it was 45 or 50 minutes, then realized it was past midnight.

They don't touch much on the Russia issue, no mention of Cambridge Analytica, or how they turned social media against itself. That part, to me being a software engineer, is even more interesting.
