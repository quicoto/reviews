This second part, of almost two hours, triggered so many thoughts. The USA system in regards to the Commander in Chief is plain wrong. The system should prevent things like this to happen.

I'm not talking about electing someone, that as far as we know, is democratic. People vote and the votes are counted. You could question the legitimacy of the votes, but that's another issue.

You could also talk about a foreign government creating a cyber campaign to throw the election in their favor, something which seems to have been proven with Russia (fake news, bots, trolls...). How they took advantage of the social media algorithms to push content to certain demographics with fake material.

What I'm most surprised about is that the president has this immunity. Much like the King in Spain, who can't be prosecuted. It seems on the other hand that legislation in the US of A could in theory remove a sitting president from office.
The truth, being told by the facts in this docuseries, is that the president has the power to remove those who could investigate him. Namely the Director of the FBI, and other heads in the Department of Justice.
Playing this card, allowing the politics to be above these institutions is plane wrong. As depicted in the series, Director Comey has the personal policy of not engaging in a relationship with the sitting president. To prevent their possible relationship could affect investigations against POUTS. Which is clearly what happens here.

Jeff Daniels delivers. You can see in his face as the episode progresses, the pain the character feels working for Mr. Trump. How he loves what the FBI represents but is forced to step out because of a chain of command that should not exist.

All and all I would recommend the series, even if not living in the USA it gives you an interesting insight into the incidents that occurred when Donald Trump took the oval office.
