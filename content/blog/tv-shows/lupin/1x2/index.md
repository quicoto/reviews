So the whole season is going to be him questing to avenge his dead father? Not a bad premise. Alright, let's see how far this rabbit hole goes.

The whole getting into the prison was somewhat believable. The exodus, that was some Mission Impossible shit.

How did the librarian keep a book that a random inmate gave him 25 years ago? Yeah, no. Why?

The thugs at the prison stabbed him? If you stab the person who owns your money, they won't be able to pay you back. I guess it was a calculated stabbing to let him live. Oh wait, they wanted to hang him the following night. What!?

I don't know, this episode was less realistic. Interesting, sure, but wasn't as well thought as the first one.

I'll continue watching, see what they come up with for the next one.
