Damn! The dude kicks ass. The life regeneration scene was badass. Good for him for helping her, and sending those players to prisons. Too bad they didn't explain how that works. 

Up to this point, you start to question yourself... what would you do in their place? Would you level up and then retire yourself to the lower levels where you can't die? Spend the rest of your days waiting for the lead group to clear all the levels? It would certainly be a valid strategy but it would also mean a slow death in real life. How long would your body hold on? Would it be 1 year, 10 years? 

Maybe trying to help clean out the game would mean more years in the real world after you got out.
