Liz lost this round. Although she gained a new friend, which is a win in any case.

The scene where Kirito snaps "her best sword" in half was funny. Very practical, you need to test the sword. As they were tested back in ancient Japan with the Samurai. Many stories are told of how swords were tested on criminals and death-sentenced prisoners. Who knows...
