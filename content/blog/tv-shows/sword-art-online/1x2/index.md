Brutal second episode. Straight to the point, the boss challenge.

Kirito sacrificed his image for the fallen beta tester, who strangely preferred to die and to be saved by an HP potion? That lacked of any sense to me, or the subs didn't correctly translate. Why not heal yourself and live to fight another day?

The cloak of midnight is a very cool item 😎
