Such a sad and yet necessary episode, to build up and evolve Kirito's character.

I too don't understand why would you hide your level, if that put your guild in jeopardy. Does this mean the monsters were of higher level because of Kirito's level? Could be.

You can't help but to feel bad for the guild that just died, for real.
