It's done. Very good show all around. The happy ending makes it extra sweet. 

The meeting at the pub was very nostalgic, a closure we all needed after so much suffering. 

One can drop the series right here and sleep happily. The following seasons, I'm afraid, aren't as good.

Thank you for the good run!
