You could feel the rage as well as despair when Kirito fought the guardians of the world tree.

But I guess the main focus this episode is their relationship. I honestly don't get it. Love? It's fine to love a family member. My guess is she doesn't really know what love means, or what can mean. Why can't you love your brother in a non-romantic way?

Meh...
