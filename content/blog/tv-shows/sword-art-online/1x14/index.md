Very emotional ending. The last fight did not live up to the hype. I think it was a good plot twist but I would've liked more fighting. Also, what the hell with Kirito reviving enough just to stab the boss?

So he woke up after 2 years and could stand upright? Hard to believe but you know... it's the power of love.

Happy ending, for now.
