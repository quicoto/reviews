Not bad! Lots of yelling by Asta, the main character.

The drawing is good, as well as the animation. I don't quite like Yuno, the brother, but perhaps too soon to tell. The drawing and attitude. Dude, have more empathy. I hope they'll dig a little more where that comes from.

Has the plot moved a little too fast? We started with Asta not having any powers and ends up having a book of 5 clovers.

I'm sold, onto the next!
