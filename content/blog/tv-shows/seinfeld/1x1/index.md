Ashamed that I hadn't seen this before. It looks super old, well that's because it is. It's from 1989, which I think adds an extra kick if you're watching this in 2020.

Some jokes might be a little outdated for our modern age. Especially when talking about men and women. Still, if you move past that... it's not bad!
