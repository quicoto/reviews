Wow, this episode was so much better than the first one.

I don't where to even start. Creat acting by our main character. The strange dynamic with the shady husband and the wise. Is he cheating on her with someone else or is he a crook? In any case strange that they decide to adopt to not pay any attention to her. Was it just to appear "normal" as a family?

Not unexpected reaction from Beth when she realizes that big ass room is all by herself.

School? Well, we all know how high school works. We found cliches with the girls that want to play the wife role and Beth who is interested in chess, and nothing else.

I loved the ass-kicking in the tournament. How the two shmucks from the reception were telling her off because she's a woman. She wins it all!

I liked that man, who first approached her and lost like a gentleman. Unlike the former state champion, who even if he gave nice comments to the newspaper looked like a sore loser.

Here's my question though... Did she win because of the drugs? Could've she won without them? I guess we'll find out soon enough.

Great twist at the end when her new mother realizes she's a gold mine and has a plan all laid out. She clearly has mental issues, which I could understand having such a husband. How will this move from here? Will the mother try to take advantage? I don't think Beth dislikes the idea of just keep playing better and better people, while making some money at the same time.

Now that she has bought her own chess set, she'll be unstoppable.
