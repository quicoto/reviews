Finally, finally she lost a game. She didn't take it too kindly. But I guess that's expected if you're always winning a loss will hurt twice as much.

I did not fully understand the hotel room scene. Was that magazine dude after her but in a gay relationship with that other dude? Who cares...

So the final match. At first, I thought the matrix-looking champion would lose, that he might be perhaps too much talk. Then of course he's the US champion, she got there with skill. Good that she beat her, you can't possibly win everything and this experience surely will make her stronger.

I felt a little bad for the mother. First, she kindle asks for 10% of the winnings, which Beths increases to 15% share. She's accompanying her everywhere, taking care of the logistics so she can play and she treats her like that. I guess it was the heat of the moment, after losing. Thankfully she reaches out for her mother's hand in the taxi.
