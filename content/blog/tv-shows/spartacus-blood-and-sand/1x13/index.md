Magnificent finale. How Spartacus ends up convincing Crixus that being a slave is no life.

A little surprised with the Doctore, I guess recent events such as Barca's freedom scaled the balance towards rebellion.

I felt great pleasure in seeing Aurelia end the life of the kid who sentenced Varro for no good reason.

There was so much blood in the end. When Crixus screams "kill them all", freaking epic. Nothing you can do against trained gladiators. Nothing but die.
