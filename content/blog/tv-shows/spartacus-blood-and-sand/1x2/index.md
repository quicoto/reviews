Poor Crixus was tricked as he looked away to confirm the kill in the final test.

It's hard for me to review these episodes since it's a re-watch. It has been some years but I do remember what this season is about. I can't but help to get a little emotional when seeing characters that will not make it to the next season.

I like how in the second match of the game Barca finished the trainee with a single movement. Unexpected. The laugh from the other gladiators afterward? not so much.
