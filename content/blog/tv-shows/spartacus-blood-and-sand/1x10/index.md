This is surely the saddest episode of the whole series. How the build up his relationship with Varro, to such extent that you envy having such a good friend.

Then they take it away in the most inglorious and twisted way. Varro did not deserve to die. In the arena perhaps, his choice. To think that a free man would submit himself to the ludus, for honor, instead of fleeing to foreign lands.

What about this wife? Now to be a widow.

Spartacus looked really broken at the end. Vulnerable and probably fed with all the bullshit. A reckoning is coming, one that I shall enjoy very much.
