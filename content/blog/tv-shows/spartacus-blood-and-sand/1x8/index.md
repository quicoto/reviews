The woman says to the slave: "I can provide with wine, woman, freedom"

Suddenly the slave reacts to the last word. To what she says: "You desire such a thing?"

How is a slave not to desire freedom. For the love of God!

Ilithyia is one of the worst characters I've ever seen. Not the acting, the actress does a great job. But how evil, twisted, and rotten the character is. It infuriates me.
