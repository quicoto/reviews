Spartacus thought Crixus was an easy opponent. Far from it. I like how they showed Crixus' hard work, it paid off. It is indeed the Champion of Capua.

You could see how raising the fingers broke Spartacus' spirit. Yet I'm not sure why letting him live? If they give the 2 fingers are exempt of execution? 👎 

Or was it a pure business decision? Batiatus paid a high price for him and wants to see the investment returned?
