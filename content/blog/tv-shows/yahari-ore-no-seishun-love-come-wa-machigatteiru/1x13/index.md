It certainly ended up better than episode 12th. They wanted to give us a picture of unity and better communication at the club. No need for constant verbal stabbing.

Totsuka priceless as usual, defeating all enemies with his cuteness. I need him for season 2, please!

Overall not a bad anime. Atypical, which is good but on the other side it made me hate some of the characters in a few episodes. I am not sure if the characters have evolved much. Their relationship? Sure. Now maybe they could even be called friends but have they learned anything? Will they change their stupid pride and rotten view of the world? Unlikely from what I've watched.
