This episode was so much better! Again the classic the high-school live trying to fake friendship so you can be one more of the pack. Lame. Sad.

Glad to see Hachiman couldn't stand the situation and wanted to intervene, even if unsuccessful. I like that he has a sense of justice and integrity.

As I become older I seem not to be able to tolerate these irritating kids anymore. I've seen my fair share of bullshit and life is too precious to try and be fake to please others.
