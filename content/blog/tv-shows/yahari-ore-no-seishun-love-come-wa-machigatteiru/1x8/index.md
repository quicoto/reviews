The plot thickens! So the love triangle is connected. Ok "love triangle" might not be accurate since the only who somewhat shows her feelings is Yuigahama. The other two are natural enemies. Fire and water.

It's so funny the gags with Totsuka, Hachiman is about to fall in love with him. I love how he doesn't seem able to resist Totsuka cuteness 😂
