Yet another fun episode.

I'm not sure if there's an actual comic convention on Christmas eve. I knew about the one in summer. Portraited in many other animes. Sweety people queuing to gain access to the building.

Looks like we have a new character appearing. She likes our Serinuma. The boys will have an even harder time now.

If you ask me, right at this moment, what couple do I ship. It should definitely be with her _senpai_. Serinuma and Mutsumi, the chill grown-up which seem to always be on board, and appears to be more interested on what's inside rather than her looks. He was the one that recognized her at first glance after she lost weight.
