Funny, no doubt. I think the main character is a little bit oblivious of the 4 guys' real intentions.

They don't want to be friend-zones, they don't want more pals, they want her as a girlfriend. I feel like if this goes on she'll only be selfish to them.

Maybe this is not that type of anime and they'll continue with the comedy all the way. I wish things would progress, love-wise.
