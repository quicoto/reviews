Wanted a recommendation based on _Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii_, it seems this one might be it.

I was about to drop it half episide due to the art but then it suddenly changed, so all good.

I feel bad for the guys, I think they don't stand much a chance. I guess they'll keep playing the game until (hopefully) at the end she'll be with one of them?
