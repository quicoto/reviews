It's good that Igarashi realized he likes Serinuma even if he's not super thin.

Will the other realize the same? It's hard to tell what you would do in these situations. I want to believe it depends on how far your relationship is. If you just met, there's no way the looks won't affect you. On the other hand, if you're already if you've known the person for a long time it might not affect (or would it?)

In any case, I see the show is slowly moving forward. It was super funny how Nanashima and Shinomiya came up with the plan to give her fanservice if she reacher her goals üòÇ

P.S. I knew Sinomiya's voice was familiar. Looks like Matsuoka Yoshitsugu is the actor behind it and he has done the main characters for Sword Art Online and Shokugeki no Souma. Surprised to see an actor with such powerful roles and quite unforgettable roles do this supporting role here.
