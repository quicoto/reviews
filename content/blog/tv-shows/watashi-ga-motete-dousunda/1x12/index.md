Bullshit. Such a bad ending, to be honest. Ok, it's was a comedy but you could've ended it with the Senpai and we would've all been very happy.

She does not even realize how lucky she is and she's wasting it on anime.

Don't get me wrong, though. I like anime but I think you can have both. Especially with them, who all acknowledged her otaku side.

Maybe I should've seen this coming. I have faith in people and they disappoint, this anime is no different.
