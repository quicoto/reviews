Nice episode right here.

First, what's with Sawa's arm? Jesus, she can throw fast fastballs and at least 4 break balls. Who are you?
The only explanation on why she wasn't pitching or why her friend wants her to take it easy must be a past injury. Which could re-surface? Although knowing how animes go it could be some sort of mental trauma.

And how about Goro making an appearance at the end, c'mon give us some fan service!
