Excellent episode. We've got a bit of everything, we even saw Mando's face again.

When he says he's going to join the prisoner infiltrate I thought he was going to take the helmet off. I did not imagine them wearing stormtrooper armor. Which is complete crap as we saw. Mando's fighting style relies on the beskar, he quickly realized the trooper's armor does not protect him as his precious beskar.

It's weird that it felt good when the tie-fighters and the infantry showed on the bridge to provide cover to the transport. They're the bad guys but I guess they played with our feelings of putting Mando in jeopardy.

I loved the two women covering Mando's exfiltration with their sniping, great shooting. I'm glad Cara Dune is sticking with them and following through to the next episode. I hope they can live up to the hype they've created with Moff Gideon. The message Mando sends repeating Gideon's words, priceless.

Wasn't it cool to see a little bit the inside of Fett's ship? How the whole thing works as it takes off in a somewhat horizontal position. Doesn't seem practical but it looks damn cool.
