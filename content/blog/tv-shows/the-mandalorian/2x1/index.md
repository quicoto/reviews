Well, this was great. The same energy and high production from the first season. Each episode looks like a freaking movie, it's so well done.

We've got our dose of fanservice with The Child doing cute things.

We've plenty of action by Mando, kicking ass as usual in hand to hand combat, blaster, and whatever is needed.

The one bit that I couldn't get my head around was how the acid from the beast didn't burn him. At first, I thought that maybe the armor would protect him but he has also what seem regular clothes in between armor pieces. Still, it was awesome to get swallowed and destroy it from the inside. Not something we haven't seen before but badass nonetheless.

I'm very impressed with how Disney ruined the Star Wars saga but then come up with this show.
