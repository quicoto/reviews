Like the first episode, it felt so short!

The first thing that made me say "huh?" was when the dessert bandits ambush Mando and they say "get the child". It looks to me it was not a random attack to mug him but rather targeted to kidnap the child. No surprise Mando kicks their ugly asses to the dust.

Baby Yoda doing cute things again stealing the frog's eggs. Cute but, c'mon dude, don't do that.

I loved how the frog engineered a contraption so its voice was translated using the android hardware. Well done!

How about some dogfight? Short but yet awesome. It was super cool when without saying a word the X-Wings put their wings in attack position. I would've liked it if someone fired but well.

Tell me, didn't you think those spider eggs were Aliens? Face huggers? That was my first impression. They opened from the top, slimy juices inside and a sort of spider emerging from it. Then I realized, it can't be. No way they copied this. They did not but it looks to me too close to be a coincidence.

The whole spider run scene made me cringe! Oh my, I hate spiders. There were so many and they started crawling on the ship. Argh! Luckily the two X-Wing pilots decided to help.

How can he fix the ship so fast? The cockpit glass was broken and lots of parts of the ship were severely damaged. I like that the ship seemed to have problems flying when they left the planet. Still, Mando had such a small toolbox. Must be a magic toolbox to be able to repair such a complex piece of machinery.
