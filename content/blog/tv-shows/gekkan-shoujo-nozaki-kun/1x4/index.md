This one was way funnier than the previous one. Playing that game in Nozaki's house was hilarious, especially when they felt bad for the friend in the game.

Plot-wise I don't know if Sakura will try to advance her relationship with Nozaki any further. She seems to be content at the moment but would love to see it evolve.
