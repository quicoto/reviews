This is way too short to enjoy!

So now they both know each other's feelings, they just need to make the first step. Interesting.

I'm not liking the rich boy's personality. Not unexpected but still a little infuriating how he toys with his employee, which one would think is also his best friend. They sleep together (sleeping!), for god's sake.
