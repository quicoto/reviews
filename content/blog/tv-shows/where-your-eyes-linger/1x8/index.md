Such a weird ending.

3 years!? Are you kidding me?

Also what the hell with the yellow sweater Gook was wearing while working at the restaurant? Hideous.

Good that they got reunited, but 3 years?! That feels way too much to just meet each other, exchange 2 words, and start kissing. Maybe it's just me.

Multiple endings could have happened here. If you had said "1 year later", maybe would've been more credible.

Cute and sweet, not what I wanted as an ending and would've liked longer episodes.
