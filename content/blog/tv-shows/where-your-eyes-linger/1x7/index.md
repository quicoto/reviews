Nice, some martial art action there at the end. Running towards his love.

Surely he no longer works for the family. Is the rich kid going to stay in South Korea fighting his father or will he have surrendered and moved to England?

Can we talk about the weird ending? Him working at the restaurant and all the fan-girls screaming at him 😂
