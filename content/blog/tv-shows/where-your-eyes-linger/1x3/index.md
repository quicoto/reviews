Poor bodyguard quit your job. That's painful to watch.

Of course, the entitles tich brat is oblivious to Kang's feelings. Although the last scene might have shown him his true colors. We'll see...

Now I'm regretting this thing not being a little bit longer. Maybe 20 minutes? You can see it's very low production but so far it works.
