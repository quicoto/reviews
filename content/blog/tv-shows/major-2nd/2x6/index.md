This episode was surprisingly better than the previous one. Anita still bugs the hell out of me, such annoying character.

Daigo showing he's head above shoulders compared to the rest. The apperance of the old teammates was also good.

And of course winning the match against those who were looking down on them for being girls. Justice has been served.
