Anita, I'm fed up. Go home already.

I don't know, the other team feels they've worked much more together. At least for a longer time, they have a coach... Yet they can't seem to get ahead. Sakura the magician is keeping them in check, somehow.

These bastards have teased us Daigo taking home pate, finally. Now we have to wait until next week for the one episode I've been looking forward to since the championship started. Argh!
