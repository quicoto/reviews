I don't know, people on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/gtg0dj/major_2nd_season_2_episode_5_discussion/) seem to love this one, not me. The original Major was brilliant, this one.. I don't know, I feels like I don't have a main character like we had with Goro-kun.

I'm watching it because it's Major and because it might feature Goro-kun from time to time. But in all honesty the show could be called something entirely different (not Major) and work out as well. I does not seem to follow the same flow as the original one.
