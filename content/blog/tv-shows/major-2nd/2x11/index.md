Good match! Gotta confess I wasn't sure they would pull it off.

Anita finally realized how hard-working Daigo is? About time, woman.

How about the 2 teammates who left instead of staying with the team to watch the game. Even if you don't think you'll have the chance to meet that opponent... have you ever heard of the word team? team-building? teamwork?
