I'm glad they clarified that headfirst slides while running to 1st base are a bad idea, proven not to be faster than running. Yet in these damn animes, they keep doing it, for some reason. Even after they state it's not effective.

I don't like these players with such ego, like Mayumura, saying "they can't hit my pitches". Get off the high horse you little shit, they just hit your pitch. Not a base hit, I'll give you that but state that you'll get strikeouts... Don't get cocky kid.
