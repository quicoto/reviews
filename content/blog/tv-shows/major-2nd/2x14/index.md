Great episode! Felt super lengthy, with lots of goodies. Mayumura's backstory with her team (including the asshole coach) was insightful.

The teacher still cracks me up, dreaming her team has lost so she can enjoy the day off 😂

I am not sure what to expect from the next episodes, I would say they need to lose at some point but now that they've teased Hikaru... Oh my... I want them to win everything so they can meet each other again. I so much look forward for them to fight against each other but what I really look forward to is for them to team up again.
