Am I the only one who saw how Nishina lost his had when he was pitching good? A wink to Goro's powerful pitching style?

I liked how Daigo took the reigns of the team after sitting at home plate. I still hate Anita and I'm still surprised the opposing team seems to have problems beating them. Weren't you so mature and well-formed team?
