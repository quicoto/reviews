Good episode all around. Happy that we got mushroom head out of the way for a while and happy that the big sister got into the game.
I hope she can deliver in a clutch situation and show off her hidden skills.

Nishina was funny, thinking Anita was about to declare her love for him.

The infield play in the game was kick ass. Hope these high and almighty team has to eat their handicap and go home losing.
