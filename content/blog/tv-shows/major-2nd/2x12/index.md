I guess they're gonna make us wait until they confess the feelings to each other.

Nishina is too funny. I'm rooting for this guy.

Anita still irritates me, nothing new under the sun.

The infield couple is such a letdown. They're good but don't have the will to continue fighting when they see an uphill battle. Disappointing.

Good for Chisato to step up to the mound!
