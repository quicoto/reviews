I can't deal with this type of person, mushroom head is too punchable in the face. How annoying. I'm happy the girls put a stop to it when Daigo wasn't able / willing.

I don't know if the mushroom head will stay or leave, I'm quite sure the older sister will join but will Chiba do a transformation as Nishina did? Could be, for now, I don't want him to. Just go away, dude.

I liked quite a bit when Chiba said "these are like the training we did at Senior League". Happy to see Daigo's training menu is not far off from the ones a dedicated coach gives.
