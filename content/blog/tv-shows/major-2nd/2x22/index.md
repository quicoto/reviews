Nice episode, when the balls are flying it's a joy to watch. Like any sports anime when things are going good a new strong character makes an appearance. As usual, he's a little overpowered, we'll see how they work around him.

I like that the new pitcher missed the first one, it made him more human. All and all they're in middle school.

Nishina the best again, getting on base full of himself. That was funny.
