BS of the finale. Hikaru's personality screwed the whole thing.

The only good thing about this episode was Goro, I'm thinking about re-watching old Major just to see Goro again.

I'm disappointed that after 25 episodes we just got a glimpse of Hikaru, what I think we all wanted to see going into this season. We didn't get it and what we got has nonsense bullcrap.
