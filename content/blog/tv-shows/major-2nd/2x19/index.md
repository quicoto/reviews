Nice game!

This episode was good, a fresh change of pace from the game. Goro's appearance was short but good.

I could relate to the burnout the captain might succumb too, as my role as an instructor. It looks easier than it is.

Happy they all came around to realize how much of a hard work he puts in. About time, though. Were they blind or what?

Looking forward to the next one, see how they shape the team.
