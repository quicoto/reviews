Freaking Anita, acting almighty.

Daigo is too good. He should've switched her out and put himself on as a catcher. That's what I'm here to see, not Anita's character development. Daigo has been proven to be far superior in strategy and actual technique.

Meh... the preview for the next one showed Daigo with a mask, hopefully, he's sitting on the plate soon.
