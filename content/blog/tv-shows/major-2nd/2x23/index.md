Mutsuko was a little annoying wearing the ace burden. Just be mature enough to step down

Nishina for the win, by the way. I loved how he stepped up to the mound full or rage.

## The big reveal

No one was expecting this plot twist. We've seen but 10 seconds and I already have a bad feeling about this.

The few words Hikaru and Daigo exchange could be translated to "you destroyed my pitching career".

WHAT!?

Sure it's a story surprise but the fans wanted a battery reunion, not rival catchers, where the fun in that? Maybe they'll surprise us with another twist and he'll eventually pitch? Quite disappointing, especially knowing we're a few episodes away from the end of the season.
