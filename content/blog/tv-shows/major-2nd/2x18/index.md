Finally, Goro talks more than a word. Thank you for the fanservice, we need more Goro in our lives.

They don't show it but I bet the lose the game. The other team was more well-rounded, it would be too much of a stretch if they won here. Plus they need to go extra inning as they're tied.

I'd be happy if they simply lose and put their eyes on the next championship. Take a break from games, gives some slice of life scenes, and perhaps even advance a little the relationship between Daigo and Sakura.
