This episode hit harder than I expected. It felt way too real. The struggle, the pain, the death...

Lea is way more likable now, or at least in this episode. I like the duo Park and Shaun living together. I was surprised there were no tantrums about toilet paper and then, bam, the cabinet-filling-dispute. Park is such a good guy.

Dr. Andrews's face expression when he gets home and has to stay in the garage, very well executed. He transmitted the feeling quite well.

It felt a little bit forced how Glassman and his wife were fighting. I don't know maybe they didn't lay it out correctly but it felt over-exaggerated from Glassman to reject her so forcibly.

The last scene with, what might be, Melendez's ghost... that was a punch below the belt. Uncalled for.
