Profound episode. We haven't had one of these in a while, facing death and more importantly... a death that could have been prevented.

Shaun is facing a difficult challenge. Being in a leadership position is something not everybody will excel at. Some people have a very hard time managing a team.

I think we can all be leaders, even if not managing others, you can lead from within a team. The manager, the team leader, will have different accountabilities but you can lead.
With that said, Shaun could lead with his deduction and knowledgable skills, perhaps not lead in managing first-years. Let's see...

On a closing note, I appreciate how Shaun and Lea are in perfect sync and not in drama. Thank you for giving Shaun a happy, safe place at home.
