Such a sad episode. Both the girl and the boyfriend from high school are very face-punchable.

I can see where Ishigame is coming from, but seeing how everything unfolded he should've not gotten in between the two assholes. If she couldn't see how his boyfriend was cheating on her, too bad.

Ishigame is good to the core and did not deserve the treatment. Granted, he punched the guy but just let them be.
