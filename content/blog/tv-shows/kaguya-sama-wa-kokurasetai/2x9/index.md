I couldn't care less about Miko. Actually, it's starting to annoy me. I can see they wanted to refresh a little the student council, it's not working for me.

Ishigami is the best, period.

I hope the romance between our main characters will evolve at some point. We're already 9 episodes in. Kiss already!
