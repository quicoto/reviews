If you're a Star Wars fan, you will like this first episode.

Lightsabers, backstories never seen/told (or at least that I can remember), use of the force... Sure, we didn't see Obi-Wan kick-ass (yet) but it's bound to happen.

The production value is movie-like and it's so great they brought back the cast from the movies for this mini-series.
