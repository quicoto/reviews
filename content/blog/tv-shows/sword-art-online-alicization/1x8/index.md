The power of imagination? Meh, I liked much more the SAO concept. I guess they couldn't have done the same as it would've been a simple copy of the first season. Still, this feels very very slow. Kirito being so strong, here is not oustanding. Sure I don't want him to have it easy but spending years feels overkill.
