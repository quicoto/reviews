This reminds me Metal Gear Solid, when you had to climb the tall tower full of guards and traps. Same thing here.

It's going to take them what... 10 episodes to climb it? This is not a long-running *shonen*, move it along.

I liked the fight but it was way too short. The spinning shield was a joke, what a crappy sword skill. Eugeo's skill was way cooler, ice everywhere!
