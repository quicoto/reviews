The world is full of shit, proven over and over. Bad people will use other people in bad faith, for their own profit. This, even if a futuristic dystopia, is not so far fetched.

Am I an ass for wanting the story to just go back to the VR world instead of reality? Not really interested in what happened to Kirito in the real world. Ok, yes, I want to know but do it quickly and go back to swords and magic. Thanks!
