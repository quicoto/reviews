Beautiful backgrounds. I liked much more the pacing of this episode, slowly introducing the character, the world...

I thought Kirito would start playing with the "command" console right away but he went to sleep. Wasn't there maybe a "log out" button?

The moment he picked up the sword and the classic SAO soundtrack played, very cool.
