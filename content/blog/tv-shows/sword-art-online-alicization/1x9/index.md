Boring. Not interested. Move forward please, go already to that citidell or tower you're supposed to climb. What is going on with this VR game? The skill honing takes way too long. At least in player time, even if real-time is considerably shorter.

I am not really interested in how the noble assholes are pissing on the commoners, this has always happened. Nothing new. Is Eugeo's character evolving due to this confrontation? Perhaps a little. I hope we can expedite this "slice of life" in the dorms and move quickly forward plot-wise.
