Jessica looked quite vulnerable with her old husband in this episode. Harvey tried to help but she couldn't sit and wait, she had to intervene. 

The landlord dispute with Mike and the bedbugs, nice finally. I very much liked the woman opposing counsel, such a veteran. Mike dropped the ball in his first court appearance as a fake attorney.
