Oh Louis, you asshole...

I can't understand why Stan, the accountant, was so mortified for losing his job. He got a severance package, which according to Harvey is more than what he had initially gotten... Can't you do your magic numbers somewhere else even if you don't have a degree? Maybe the USA is the land of the degree. I've seen this in IT, you don't have a Computer Science degree and you're nothing, even if you're more skilled than those who have it.

I don't have a university degree. I could argue I'm more qualified and make more money than most of them I know. Degrees make sense only for certain jobs, not every job needs a university degree.
