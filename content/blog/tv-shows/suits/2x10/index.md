Oh wow, they kicked Daniel's ass. That felt good, and using the "fake" document was even better. A life lesson well learned.

Louis? What changed his mind? The episode did not show any indication of him realizing how bad Hardman was. He felt bad at the end? He saw Daniel wasn't winning and simply jumped to the other side? He should just change firms, how can you stay knowing the managing partner has a vendetta for you?
