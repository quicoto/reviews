I wanted the cab driver to pay so bad. What an asshole.

The poor limo driver did nothing wrong and wanted to squeeze him dry. Talk about honor. Disgusting. The worst part is he was all high and almighty in front of the judge and jury.

Trevor? What can we say about that loser? You can't call someone a friend who will drag you down as he did.
