This one was a roller coaster, how their plan with the interim CEO didn't work out. That was unexpected.

It was also unexpected the 500K USD as a buy-in to become a Senior Partner. Holy smokes, that's a lot of money. I guess it's not that much if you make 1000 USD per hour (as it has been said in a different episode). It's definitely a league above the mere mortal.
