I was jumping up and down because Donna was back but then Mike's grandmother leaves us. I liked the character very much, such a woman!

I guess it's part of Mike's journey that now he'll be alone, maybe welcoming Rachel into his arms? Telling her the truth?

Looking forward to the next one for the partner vote. Louis is very irritating at this stage of the series. Blinded by anger that he's caused himself. Hardman is good, very devious. Great villain.
