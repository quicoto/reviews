This was brutal. Harvey exploded in front of Louis, with valid reasons. Poor Jessica has to deal with the gunslinger, doesn't look easy.

Mike got what he deserved. He slept with Tess knowing she was married (loving her husband or not. Don't do that man. Be a gentleman).

I felt bad for Harold, I could not work a single minute in an environment as toxic as this law firm. I've never been to one but I hope they don't do these verbal exchanges. It's just too much. Harold should've punched Louis' face.

Such a powerful scene when Harvey gets to Louis' office without saying a word and rips the resignation letter in half. No words are exchanged but the message got across. Well done.
