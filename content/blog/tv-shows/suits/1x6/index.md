Ah.. the plot thickens. It's worth mentioning I've followed this show for years and I already know how it ends. Still, I get excited about the plot development, the idea that he's getting caught (no spoilers!).

Harvey being Harvey one more episode. All good.

If in the last review I was talking about how lawyers make an insane amount of cash, what about these traders? 9M USD in a transaction, what the hell...
