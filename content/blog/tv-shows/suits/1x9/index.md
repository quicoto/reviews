Oh, wow. Rachel got a hell of a deal. Not only the 10% raise but getting the firm to pay for the law school? Last I heard Harvard was 50K a year.

Loius continues to disappoint. Can't recall when does he change to be more a fair leader.

Harvey and Tanner, I liked the fight. First time we see Harvey break a sweat.
