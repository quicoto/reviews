So many ups and downs. The first episode of this 3rd season has started with a bang. I feel bad for Nigel, not for Louis. He stabbed an honest man so he deserves to lose the associates. 

Happy for Rachel and Mike! We all know he should just quit but then we wouldn't have this TV Show, we will let this slide 🙃

What does Harvey mean at the end? Does he want to take down Jessica? That's not his end goal, he wants to get rid of Darbey and put Specter up on the wall.
