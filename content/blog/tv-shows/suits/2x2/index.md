I had completely forgotten how Mike breaks off with Rachen even before starting dating.

I think Harvey made a mistake here with Jessica, now that she needed him the most he failed her. Not sure what happened at the end, how he tried to make amends but... pushing a tea cart won't solve the voting problem they're about to face.
