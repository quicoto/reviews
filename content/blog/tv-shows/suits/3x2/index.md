Poor Louis. I thought he behaved extraordinarily well this time around, a true colleague and not an authoritarian dictator. Then the all-powerful Harvey came and took the prize from under his nose. The high five was good but I can't help but to feel bad.

Quite boring this Cameron antagonist, please bring a different one.

P.S. I'm loving Mike and Rachel's chemistry.
