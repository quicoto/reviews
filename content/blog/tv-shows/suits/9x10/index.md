Such a fantastic finale. It got my eyes watery. The soundtrack, the well-crafted shots, the emotion... A big ending to a phenomenal show. Open enough that they could potentially continue in the future.

I think we got enough closure, seeing Mike again teaming up with Harvey. Such chemistry between characters and actors.

I don't think I would watch any show if it didn't involve Harvey and Donna. The characters left in the firm, especially Louis, are not bad but they're not Harvey and Donna.

Thank, Suits, you for all these years!
