Continuing where we left off in the last episode. So Meredith has COVID, an interesting turn of events. I mean, seeing her dead husband can't be a good sign.

They could kill her but I think it's too early in the season. The show is named after this character, it shouldn't be easy to kill her off. We've seen Shonda do some crazy stuff, killing a lot of people... Now, Meredith? It better be good.
First I thought, if this is happening maybe it would happen at the end of the season. However... the more I think about it, it would make sense to stretch it over a longer span of episodes. We need to set the mood, we can't rush her death, the audience needs to be on the edge of their seats.

How about Derek explaining the situation, telling her she's not ready, almost inviting her to forget about the kids and join him. That was dark. You want to leave your kids on earth to have fun with your dead husband. They need you, get a grip.
