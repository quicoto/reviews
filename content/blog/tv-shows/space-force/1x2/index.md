Alright, I'm done. It wasn't funny to me how they sent a monkey and a dog to their deaths because POTUS wanted to. I know it's a critique to the current POTUS (Mr Trump) but still, I just wasn't funny.

Chinese sabotaging a satellite that costed billions to the US and did nothing. Not sure where the show is going from there but I'm not sticking to find out.
