So many things going on in this episode. Glad to see their search was successful in finding HQ.

## Admiral

I think the admiral does a good job at being skeptical, he can't trust them right away. They shouldn't be so surprised he doesn't. He eventually comes around, as we suspected he would.

## Nerd alert

Love when they start saying sci-fi words, when they got to the HQ and saw all the new tech advancements. They couldn't contain their excitement. Will they upgrade Discovery with some of the new tech?

## For Starfleet

I found it funny that when they left the officer in the seed ship they departed instantly. No one questioned why isn't she beaming up, just hit the road.

## The burn

At first I was a little disappointed they knew practically nothing about "the burn" but I guess this will be used as a story vehicle to keep searching for the truth.

## Book is back, baby

How about the preview? Book is finally back! Long time no see.
