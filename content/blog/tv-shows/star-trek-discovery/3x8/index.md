This episode had brutal CGI scenes, lots of story information, and sweet moments with Book and Micheal.

## Tilly

So far great job in her new position, don't you think? Her new role suits her so well.

## Books stays

Good! It seems he intends to stick with Discovery. Let's see what Captain Saru has to say about it. For a moment we thought they might split.

## Georgiou

Worried about Georgiou, they don't have many answers to what's happening to her. She's a cool character, I don't want to lose her. It seems we've going to focus on her next week.
