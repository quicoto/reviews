Quite the emotional episode! I'm sure the trek hardcore fans have enjoyed it. Me? Not so much.

## A sea of tears

There was a lot of crying. I'm new to the Star Trek world and the old Vulcan world or Micheal's mother didn't say much to me. Spock? Sure, who doesn't know Spock?

## First officer

How about that? The promotion to first officer and everybody was more than ok with it. We're going to see Tilly change a lot in the upcoming episodes.

## Book, the lone ranger

Is he going to go? Will he stay? Now that Micheal has shared she has no intention of leaving. I hope he stays, their chemistry works really well together.
