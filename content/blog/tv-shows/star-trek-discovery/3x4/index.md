Is it just me or the lack of Book in this episode made it considerably more boring?

It wasn't bad. I liked the connection between the crew, the effort the Captain is doing the pull them together showing leadership.

How about when Micheal shots the Trills that are trying to attack Adira? That was funny "not Federation protocol" they say. I like it, less talking more shooting. In the lines of that Georgiou would do, she didn't say much in this episode but I loved every bit.

I miss the dynamic between Micheal and Book, I hope he comes back soon. In the next episode preview I didn't see him, so at least one more without him.
