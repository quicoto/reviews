Every episode brings so many things it's hard to be concise in the reviews.

I liked this one better than the last one, the jailbreak was nice. The whole "you got me at the unsanctioned mission" was hilarious. They make such a good team. I like the plot is thickening with Georgiou's flashbacks. The last one was scary but I wasn't fearing for Micheal's life.

You can clearly see how Micheal has now ideals beyond Starfleet, how she's clearly in love with Book and will go to the end of the universe to save him. I feel bad for Saru, he was put in a difficult position. Being the captain or team lead is never easy. He made the right decision demoting Michael.

Can we all appreciate the sweet moment between Stamets and Adira when she explains she can talk to her dead boyfriend? This is Star Trek, anything is possible and I like how he phrased and emphasized.

I'm glad Book is back, I hope he's here to stay. Will he stay?
