Not bad! The reunion was touchy.

The raider Wen with the plot twist, human head! Unexpected.

I would like to see how they utilize the newer technology to upgrade parts of the ship or equipment. Perhaps with the help of the 16-year-old engineering genius? Which, if I understood correctly, has some sort of parasite inside which can transfer memories from its previous host. Sounds like Stargate.

Is Book leaving? Oh, no way. We need him, the chemistry is fantastic with Michael. You could clearly see she was conflicted when saying good-bye to him.

I wish they would've shown more of that futuristic earth. In the next episode preview it looked to me it might happen on Earth.
