Hell yeah! This episode was fantastic. If only this season was consistently this good.

I liked Kita's backstory. Receiving the 1 number and breaking down was quite emotional. They did it very well. I'm liking more and more these stories.

Asahi being the ace he's supposed to be saving the point, yeah dude, more of these, please!

I feel bad for Nishinoya, I need him to cheer up and be himself again. Loud and dependable.

Tsukushima's answer to Hinata, was the cherry on top. Hinata's face was hilarious. I love this back and forth between them. They share the same middle-blocker role but they're complete opposites in personality and, obviously, height.
