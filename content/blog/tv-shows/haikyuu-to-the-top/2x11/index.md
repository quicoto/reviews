Wow. I couldn't tell for the life of me who was going to take the match. First I thought Karasuno was taking it, with all the fine plays. Then I quickly changed my mind as Inarizaki took the lead.

Some of the scenes felt like the last point but weren't. They were setting up to be epic but then suddenly made a turn of 180º.

The final quick by Inarizaki was super scary, it was done, I was so convinced we had lost the match. Then, the block...

I haven't felt my heart race watching a TV show in a while, this anime is astonishing.

## Hinata's high ball

Man, what a moment. I even took a breather myself.

## Kageyama's face!

Oh yeah, how proud was he that he set the ball for him. I love these!

## Soundtrack

The soundtrack chosen for the episode was truly epic and made the moments stand out even more.

## One more, please

I think the next one is the last one. Please tell me we'll have another season, it can not possibly end like this. Happy yes, but I can't help but want more.
