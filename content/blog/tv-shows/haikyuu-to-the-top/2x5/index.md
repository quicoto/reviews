What a fantastic episode! I need a TV series spin-off for Nekoma school, pretty please. It was so fulfilling to see them struggle and overcome the match. Such great character development for not even the main team of this show, we want more, please!

I found the animation/drawing excellent in this episode for Nekoma.

I can't wait for Karasuno vs Nekoma match. Was it for the semi-final or final in the bracket?

Everything was great and I can welcome the weekend with peace of mind after watching this episode.
