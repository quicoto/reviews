Not so good animation, again. Not as bad as the second one but distracting enough.

Users on Reddit say we're nitpicking. I'm sorry but no. We're used to top-notch drawing and animation, when it goes down we can't help but notice.

I liked the episode overall. How Kageyama is becoming a serve monster like his senior rival.

I hope Tsukishima can start blocking the hell out of them, it seems he got played in this episode and didn't look so good. Hopefully, we can get his smirk back in the next one.
