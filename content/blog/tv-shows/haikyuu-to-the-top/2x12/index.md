Such a wild ride of a season. I'm very happy that we got this. Yes, sure, the beginning had its ups and downs, especially with the outsourcing of the animation to a different studio.

The episode itself didn't have much. Just some flashbacks to the previous episode and a little bit of slice-of-life which we were missing for the whole season. Seeing the boys outside the court is fun and refreshing, I like these episodes very much. This one, in particular, was ok, too many flashbacks to the match we just witnessed.

A part from this one, the last few were very wholesome. It truly leaves you with a great aftertaste. Will we get another season? the long-awaited battle against Nekoma highschool? I sure hope so. It's what we've been promised for a very long time. They've had matches but nothing as official or as important as this tournament.
