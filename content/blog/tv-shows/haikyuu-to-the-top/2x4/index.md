Very refreshing episode. At first, I thought the other animation studio did the drawing. I couldn't confirm on Reddit but after the first scene, it looked spot on.

I thought they would've shown us how Kenma got his blond hair. I like how they bond and become true teammates. Even using his pseudonym "Tora" during the game. Youth, what a wonderful thing 😁
