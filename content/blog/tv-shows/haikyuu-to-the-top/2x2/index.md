Oh my... what the hell just happened?

I had to pause the episode and go on on Reddit. It seems this episode was outsourced to a studio called "4tune". They did a horrendous job. I don't even have the words. What's with this cowsh\*t? Why would you do this? For the money I guess?

Lots of comments were complaining also about the pace of the episode, yeah ok, but for me the art did it. I could not even focus on what was going on.

It was an episode to forget. I mean, look at this piece of sh\*t:
