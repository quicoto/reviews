Not super impressed with the first chapter. Light action here and there, a good parkour scene on the rooftops of Mos Espa, and a glimpse of how Bobba Fet survived being thrown into the sand warm by Han Solo.

That particular bit was interesting but showed basically nothing. I also liked how he now seats in Jabba the Hutt throne. The memories!

If you're not a hardcore fan you might have problems pinpointing the exact moment in the timeline. I'm a little bit lost, not sure where we are. Right after The Mandalorian?

I'll continue watching, it's Star Wars universe but doesn't look too promising.
