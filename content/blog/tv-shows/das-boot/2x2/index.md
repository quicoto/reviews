Finally the American shows his true colors. I feel for the German Captain who has to help his enemies in war.

Still, I'm not sure what Hoffman's allegiance is with. He clearly wants to go back, he follows orders but I don't think he's for the cause. The genocide.

I was hoping the old crew would be shot but I guess it was the lieutenant word against theirs. Looking forward when Captain Hoffman reappears and has them all shot. Or perhaps Hoffman gets in a submarine fight with them and wins.
