Quite boring episode. Yet, there was so much plot advancement. It's no good the plot was so slow during the last episodes and then in one episode they climax everything.

Until the last 10 seconds of the season, I was still waiting for Captain Hoffman to appear in his boat and court-martial all the mutineers and puts them against the wall. Captain, where are you!? Couldn't they have had a ship or submarine found him?

Oh boy, he is back. Is the second season going to be about boats or will it happen all inland? I need submarines, dude!
