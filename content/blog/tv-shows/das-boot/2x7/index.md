Oh man, after an outstanding maneuver to destroy the pursuing u-boat his honor loses him. Now he's welcomed the ginger captain into his submarine and the mutineers have taken the guns...

What about Hoffman? Confessing his secrets to his lover wasn't worked very well for him. Can you blame her? She can't trust his words. Although you also need to understand that Hoffman is in an impossible position. If he tells the truth from the start he becomes a prisoner of war, if he lies becomes a filthy lier. Lose-lose situation.
