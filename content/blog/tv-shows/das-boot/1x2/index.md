The plot thickens, I want to see more of the submarine and less of the spies plot. Quite strange. Was the morphine only to kill people or was that "chief spy" addicted to it? We couldn't see what was she using it for.

I feel bad for the interpreter woman who has been put in the crossfire.

I liked quite a bit how the (American?) man with the fedora hat from the ship was all nonchalant when presented to the u-boat captain but right when the shit hit the fan with the areal strike he wet his pants. Not saying I wouldn't be scared but perhaps I would've not have acted so tough a minute ago.
