Such a good episode ending. The new self-appointed captain has gone even crazier trying to ram the submarine against a destroyer. Madness.

Madness because if you're logical if you really want to damage the ship convoy you stay in the fight and lunch torpedos. You wouldn't suicide yourself just taking 1 ship with you.

The face of the first officer when he realizes he's in bed with a crazy man and wishes he would've not kicked out his former captain off the boat.
