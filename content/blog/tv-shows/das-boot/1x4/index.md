So much tension with the prisoner exchange at the ship. I'm loving that plot way more than the whole Gestapo / french / spy thing.

Now the captain is ill, will the first officer take over and attack those destroyers? Or any other target?

It was funny to see the cook also being the doctor, or as we saw... the butcher.
