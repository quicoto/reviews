They blew a 3 season worth of budget in this one. First with the song royalties: Queen and The Police, amongst the top.

So many choreographies, which could have not been easy to shoot. I presume everybody was singing their own parts. Tom Ellis (Lucifer) spectacular as usual.

This episode was phenomenal. When Chole meets God and slaps him (verbally) about being a bad father. Go, girl!

Daniel's moment when he realizes he was in bed with the Almighty Goddess. Priceless face reactions. How God menacingly tucks his shirt, so funny.
