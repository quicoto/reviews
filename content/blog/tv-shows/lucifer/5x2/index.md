I've got to tell you I was getting a little bit tired of the episode, how Chloe was being lied to was quite painful. Not white lies but lies about love, that's a different league.

Surprised that Maze or Amenadude would nod recognize that's not Lucifer. I thought they had spider-senses.

How about the cliffhanger? Oh bad boys, they know how you make you binge-watch.
