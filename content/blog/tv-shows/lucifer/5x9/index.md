## Lucifer is back!

The family dinner was crazy, I love how Linda reacts to God. It's hilarious. I need more of that.

I'm glad Micheal is back in heaven. A little tired of him.

Sad for Chloe and Lucy's realization. I think he can change, even if he is his father's son. Why shouldn't he be able to love? That's bullcrap.
