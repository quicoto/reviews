Great finally. Super bloody and tying lots of loose ends.

First the sad end of Oenomaus, the sight sweetens to the thought of him returning to his wife's arms in the afterlife.

Lucretia the ever crazy woman, she too reunited with her husband robbing Gabler's wife of her child. Her, we presume, also dead in the Ludus' arena.

We're so far away from the days of training in the Ludus. Such a dark season this has been.
