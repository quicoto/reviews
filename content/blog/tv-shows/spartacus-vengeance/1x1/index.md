Big shoes to fill for the new actor portraying, Spartacus.

I think they've toned down the overall sex scenes. Even in the brothel, it was very minor compared to previous seasons.

Doctore kicked ass when the thugs tried to seize him. Well deserved. He still got it.

I like the forged brotherhood between Spartacus and Crixus, more strong than ever.

Aurelia met her fate, at least. Leaving alone, not the best idea. The poor woman had a terrible life. First losing her husband to a Ludus, to be killed in it. She, raped but a man to then become a slave herself. Now dead, a free woman at least.
