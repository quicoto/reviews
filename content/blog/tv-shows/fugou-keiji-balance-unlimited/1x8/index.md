How this dude killed 2 police officers and made a bloody mess? I understand one of the officers was old and the attacker had a knife... still, no weapon? If Cho-san knew o presumed someone will appear why not arm himself? I'm sorry it makes no sense.

And don't get me started with Suzue pointing that gun, taser-like, to her father and unable to shot him even after he attacks.

Too much BS in this episode.
