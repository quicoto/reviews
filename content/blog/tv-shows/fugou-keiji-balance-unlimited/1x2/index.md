I'm with Kato, the rich boy is irritating. He thinks he can solve everything with money, which is a nice thought but money can't buy everything.

Sadly we're discovering everybody has a price, thus he's getting away with using his money to solve crimes.

We saw a glimpse of how Kato got to that "modern crimes" division. I guess we'll slowly explore more in the next episodes.
