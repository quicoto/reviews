Kato is too good! Glad he's back to his old self and could overcome his PTSD.

Kambe being Kambe yet another episode with a nice twist. He wanted to arrest his father and not kill him, even if the tried to kill his son multiple times.

I guess the story continues, I can't see this stretching for much too long.
