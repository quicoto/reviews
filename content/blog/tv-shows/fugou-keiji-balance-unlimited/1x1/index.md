Ok, I'm intrigued. Why no anime has the guts to kill characters? I would've killed the 2 petty thieves? I would've. Next time don't go robbing a store with guns blazing.

I'm with our humble officer, the other dude deserves a good punch in the face. I'm looking forward to seeing the character development here. Right now it seems they're like fire and water. How will they work together? Will one learn from the other? Coming both to a common ground?
