I was thinking the rich boy looks a little like Batman. First of all he's rich, wants to fight crime, and has access to advanced technology. In today's episode he even had a fancy grapling hook.

The only difference I guess Batman wants to fight crime with his fists and this dude with his money.

I hope they will present a case, or cases, where money can't be used to solve it. A case where money has no effect. What is he going to do then? Is he only a fancy suit or does it has what it takes to be a cop?
