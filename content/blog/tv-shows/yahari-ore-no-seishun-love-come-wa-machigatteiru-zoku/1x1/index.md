The new season starts right after the last episode. No time jump.

What has jumped though is the art on our main character. His eyes, his face, no longer looks the same. The other characters seem unaltered, then why would they modify him? Was the author not happy with how he looked?
Certainly, his were different from the rest but this is an anime, I can't possibly imagine fans complaining about how he was drawn. Unless... unless it was so different from the manga and wanted to apply a correction?

Whatever the case might be I'm sure I'll get used to it by the second or third episode.

This one, as usual, makes me laugh every time Hachiman interacts with Totsuka. So funny how he's truly drawn to his cuteness. Love? Could be. I would ship it, no questions asked.
