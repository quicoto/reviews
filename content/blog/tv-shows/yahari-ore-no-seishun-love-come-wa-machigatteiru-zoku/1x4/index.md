Why am I watching this drama? I don't know.

The whole scene about the middle school friends going on a date and then Hayato defending Hikigaya was like: What?! Why?!

Why go through all the trouble and pretending. He already knew how screwed up those girls were.

Anyway, current mood is bad. I'll continue since I've come this far but I'm not enjoying it. It might just me, though.
