It's back! Quite the spectacle on the first one. Explosions, shootings, and a hell of a plot twist.

Poor Diego. Not sure how he let himself get captured, couldn't he have killed them all? Knife master? Not so much... Also, trying to save the president? Hasn't he seen Back to the Future? You don't go back in time and try to alter the past. It's a formula for disaster. 

How about the end? When Luther says he no longer cares if the world ends. The one who acted as a hero the most has lost interest.
