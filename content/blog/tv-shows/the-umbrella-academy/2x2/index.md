So their father is also an expert martial artist? At least when he was young. I find that hard to believe, Diego not able to kick his ass.

What about Allison? Certainly one of the siblings who had it rougher going back in time, and yet she didn't use her powers when she and her husband were harassed by the police? I understand not wanting to reveal her powers in front of him but when she's by herself at the police station? Why not?

I guess these first episodes are going to show us how everyone reconnects and they eventually fight the apocalypse together or perish in the intent.
