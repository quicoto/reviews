Such a letdown. Himawari has the genes from Naruto and the Hyuga clan and his powerful eye does not want to pursuit being a ninja.

Yeah if this was real life I would understand but c'mon we're talking about a ninja show. I would not like if she would simply start the academy at this point, when Boruto barely finished it. But sure, why not. I wouldn't mind some arcs from Himawari at the academy.
