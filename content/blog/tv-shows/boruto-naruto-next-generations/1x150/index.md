Oh c'mon! The cliffhanger with the boss fight!

I'm happy we've come back to regular missions and ninja stuff. To be honest, the prison arc really bored me.

Will this experience change Tento's life? Will he stop piggybacking on his father and start working is butt off, on his own?

I don't think this gangster might be any strong but as usual, I imagine the fights will have ups and downs. Looking forward to it.
