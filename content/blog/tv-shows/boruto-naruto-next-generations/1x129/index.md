This was nostalgic, sad, and funny at the same time. I hope Boruto grows from this. He needs to show more appreciation for having a big house with a mum, dad, and sister. Naruto had nothing but Jiraiya and his friends (which at the beginning were none).

At the end of the episode, I think Boruto realized what he has. I'm looking forward to the interactions with them once he gets back.
