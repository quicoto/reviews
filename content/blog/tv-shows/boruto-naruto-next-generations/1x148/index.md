Refreshing episode after the whole prison thing. The rich kid has a very punchable face. With that attitude, so irritating. The poor thing is probably super sad on the inside, daddy issues.

Still, I was constantly eye-rolling... grow up.

I also liked they are again back to the main storyline, referring to that battle and those scary words about Boruto's eye.

What's going to happen in the next episode? Well, Boruto being so nice (like his father) will win the kid over and they'll become friends. Curing him of the smug attitude.
