Orochimaru, this dude should be dead. Should've been killed multiple times.

I honestly don't quite like how they hold on to the old characters. They either put them in or not. Create new ones, don't reuse and trigger our nostalgia. Same with Kakashi supervising Boruto's training... Anyway, I hope the next one will bring a nice fight.
