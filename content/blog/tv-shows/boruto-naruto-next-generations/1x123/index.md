Nooooo! Tenmari and Shikadai got their chakra robbed. Unexpected. Well done.

I have zero idea what Shinki and Boruto have ahead. The white floating devil could simply attack but rather he wants to have fun first.

I feel a trend in Boruto where enemies are rather easy to beat. In the old Naruto days enemies were more formidable. I don't mean the big season bosses but rather those they encountered on the road. Remember Zabuza?
