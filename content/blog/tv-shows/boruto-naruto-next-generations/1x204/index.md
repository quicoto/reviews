Such an impressive fighting scene. We needed this for so long! Naruto and Sasuke all out. Fantastic.

As usual in this anime new enemies are yet more overpowered. I remember when Susanoo technique has unbreakable. The most overpowered (back then) technique there was. Today it was useless.

Same for the Tailed Beast Mode, throwing those bombs which would obliterate mountains. Not effective today. Damn!

You can't ask for more comparing the other 203 episodes in this series.
