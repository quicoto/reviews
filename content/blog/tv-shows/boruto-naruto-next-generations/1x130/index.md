Seeing everybody again was great. It brought back sad memories about Sasuke and Naruto's solitude but it was warm to see the original gang back together.

Such a cliffhanger at the end, I would imagine we're bound to see a nice fight. But how will this play out without revealing Sasuke's and Boruto's true skills? At that point in time even if Naruto had more chakra than Boruto, it feels Boruto is stronger.
