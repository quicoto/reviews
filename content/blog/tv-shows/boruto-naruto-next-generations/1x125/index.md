Shinki! Ok you came back for Boruto after you completed the mission. They put up a good fight against the white coated guy.

I still can't wrap my head around the idea of having trains to go from the Leaf to the Hidden Sand Village. Is it like in the old far west and the trains get attacked or robbed? Do they have ninja scorts? So many questions...
