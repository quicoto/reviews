First of all, total bullshit the memories got erased. Even if Sasuke explained what happened to them. Do you think the future would've changed? I don't think so. Maybe it would've been a full circle saying "We named you Boruto because of a friend I met a long time ago".

Second, total bullshit Boruto said: "Jiraiya didn't seem that great". Ungrateful insect, if you had your eyes open you would've noticed how good he was. Ok, he somewhat fixed it by saying "he was cool". Meh.

The only good thing seems to be that Naruto and Boruto's bond is now a little bit stronger. Or at least they seem closer to each other.
