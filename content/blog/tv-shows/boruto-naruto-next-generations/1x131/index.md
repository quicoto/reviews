I was expecting so much more from this episode. It was rather dull. The fighting scene was poor. I guess it meant as a way to make Boruto more aware of his dad and how rough he had it back then.

Boruto is still too naive and oblivious. I'm surprised they didn't teach him more about the Leaf history or his dad's past (when he was in his current timeline).

I was also expecting a more serious reaction from Jiraiya when seeing the rasengan attack by Buruto. Like, go in full speed serious mode. He just summoned a mid-sized frog. Lost opportunity to show off there.
