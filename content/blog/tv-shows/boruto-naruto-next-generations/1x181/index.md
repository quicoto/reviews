Such a lost opportunity in this episode. They could've made the long-awaited fight much cooler. Yes, we saw some of Boruto's new tricks but it was no fun. Naruto did not have to put up a fight with that secret ninja tool.
I was expecting Naruto to show his experience, his huge amount of chakra, and overall superiority. No such thing. Sad.
