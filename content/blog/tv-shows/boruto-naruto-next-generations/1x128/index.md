Now they've done it. Time travel! Hell yeah!

Can't say for sure but since we have the 4th Hokage stone face we're back when Naruto was young. Will Boruto meet his dad?! He must!

Will this be the classic "I meet my younger dad and respect him so much more once I'm back"

This has a lot of potential, let's see how long they play it out. I hope it is just not 1 episode.
