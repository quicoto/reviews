Good one! It was entertaining that Sarada is no good at medical ninjutsu. It would've been boring that she would've just inherited the talent. There's no such thing but hard work, like her mother.

It was funny how she could bullshit her way into next level assignments by sheer luck thanks to her teammates. Her internal struggle was real 😂
