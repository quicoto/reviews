Finally! Great fighting, great animation and we're doing with this arc. Finally done.

I still remember back in the beginnings of Naruto when a _Jōnin_ level ninja was scary. Konohamaru now that he has supposedly reached that level is not scary at all. Everybody is too overpowered, I guess it's the classic pitfall of any _shounen_ anime.

Happy to see Mitsuki back with the team, it was overdue.

How about Orochimaru? Short fight but good! He hasn't lost his edge. Although, again, he was way scarier back in the Naruto era.
