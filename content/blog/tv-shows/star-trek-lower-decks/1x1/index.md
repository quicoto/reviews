I'm not a Star Trek fan but when I saw the trailer for this new TV Show it caught my eye. We've had quite some good animations lately (Rick and Morty, Final Space, Solar Opposites...

I might have missed some references during this first episode which could've made it funnier. Still, it was entertaining. Above-average considering the crap that gets released nowadays.

The main characters are so far ok and the concept of this "lower" crew is a fresh point of view of a more classical hero-type senior crew on the bridge. I will continue watching. Too bad they didn't release the whole season at once, Netflix style.
