Not the start of the second season I was hoping for especially with Boimler making a very small appearance at the end. One can only hope he's coming back soon to the Cerritos.

The whole mum/daughter dynamic was something not only the characters didn't like, same here. Especially treatment is no good if you want people to respect the chain of command.

The episode was a little boring, just to tell we might be getting "back to normal" on their lives at lower decks.
