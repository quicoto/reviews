Argh! Mariner is so irritating, I feel so bad for Boimler. I think I identify with him, I usually follow the rules but sadly in this world (and apparently also in Star Trek universe) following the rules might not get you where you want.

The whole ascension thing was a little weird, the koala was extra weird "What does it know?!" 😂
