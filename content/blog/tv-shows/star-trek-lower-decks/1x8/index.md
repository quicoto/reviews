I'm liking this show more and more, I don't want it to end with just a single season.

Greanted, this episode has more than the average references to old Star Trek that I did not get. However it didn't prevent me from enjoying the episode. This ship is like any regular company where the higher ups know more than the lower decks, the grunts... That's ok too, the more you know the more work you probably have to do or more worried you end up being. Hopefully the pay is higher but there's more than higher salary.
