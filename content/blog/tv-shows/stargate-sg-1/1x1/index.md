It has been many years since I last watched an episode of Stargate. Great memories. I used to watch it with my brother, dubbed into Catalan.

Now it's on Amazon Prime and in its original version, English.

It's good. The double-length pilot episode goes straight to the point. Straight to traveling to another world. The whole plot with the ancient Egyptian Gods, genius.

Ah, it's so good to see Teal'c, I love this character.
