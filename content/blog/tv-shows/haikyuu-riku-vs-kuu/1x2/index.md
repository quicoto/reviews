Fantastic, seeing Nekoma again play excellent defense. Seeing them also grow and improve was very pleasant.

How about the snakes losing? That was also fun to see. Now I know where this guy and girl come from in the main Haikyuu season. It doesn't add too much to the plot but it makes it richer.

Would've loved to see 2 more episodes for the final match, which Bokuto's team lost. The opponent must be strong. I think we haven't seen them in action yet.

I'll say it again, I wouldn't mind seeing a complete full-length season spin-off for Nekoma high school.
