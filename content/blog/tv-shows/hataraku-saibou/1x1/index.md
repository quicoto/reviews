Not bad. After seeing Kimetsu no Yaiba this animation isn’t as great.

## White Blood Cells

Knife fight, how violent. The bloody white face. I like it.

## Romance? Not today

- Will I see you again?
- Not

It killed me.

## Technical words (in English!)

I don't know if so many technical words are going to saturate me a bit. Perhaps if the subs were in Spanish it would be more enjoyable. In English it is a bit hardcore, many of the words I have never seen before.

Do new words keep coming out throughout the season?
