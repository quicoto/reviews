Oh wow, how many times did they drop the F-word in this episode? I lost count.

Certainly not a kid-friendly cartoon. The very first scene reminded me of The Simpsons, that valley show zooming into a school. But apart from that, it is its own show.

I want to think there are no teachers/coaches like our main character. He swears more than he speaks words. Maybe too much, maybe not.

I find it funny because seems absurd that a teacher would do these things. I can see how this show is not for everyone, so far it relies a little on funny jokes and absurd gags. I want to see what direction it takes.

The pilot sold it to me, I'm in. Let's go for the next episode.
