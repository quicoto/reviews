The time jumps start to be a little confusing to me. I'm not a basketball fan and I don't know in detail the Bulls or the players timeframes.

Still, episode three has thrilling moments. Some of the plays they show, what Jordan did back then, they left me with the mouth open. The physical prowess and the control of the ball, out of this world.

MJ is simply inspiring. It can inspire you in your day to day, or in my personal case as a Haidong Gumdo instructor. He has a basket ball I have a sword. To be able to control an external object as it were part of your body, that takes a lot of work to master.
