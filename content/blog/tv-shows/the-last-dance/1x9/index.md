As they were showing the backstory of Steve Kerr I was like... Not interested. But it cracked me up on when, right after winning the NBA final, Kerr goes to a podium and explains how the last shot came to be. Saying he has to bail Jordan out, again 😂

I also realized the backstory was necessary to show how crucial Steve Kerr was to the team. The high-pressure 3-point shots, that takes balls of steel.
