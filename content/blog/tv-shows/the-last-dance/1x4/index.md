So was the front office so determined to kick out Phil Jackson as a head coach? Didn't they win the previous year? How come management was so convinced a rebuild of the team was needed.

I don't know the full story but I like how MJ says he won't play for another coach showing a lot of loyalty to the man who put the pieces together.
