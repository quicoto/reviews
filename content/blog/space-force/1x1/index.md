When I heard about this one I thought that if Steve Carrel is in it, as well as John Malkovich it would not dissapoint.

Truth is the first episode has dissapointed me a little. It felt to me like the show tries to do comedy but felt like drama in most of the scenes. The broken family (rebel child and mother in jail), the failed missile launch, the almost failed rocket launch, the russian spy... I don't know. I think you either go full comedy or you get serious. Right now the show is in between the two genres.

I'll give it another try with the second episode, since it's already available.
