Not one of the best of the series. Very cool high-speed chases but I missed a little the infiltration and actual "impossible" stuff from previous movies. Sure the scene where Hunt goes underwater to exchange some sort of disk in that power/nuclear plant was the impossible bit. But did not live up to the saga.

Also, I missed more plot twists. The only interesting one was with the UK Prime Minister.

Surely Tom Cruise must've done most of the stunts himself, as usual, which is appreciated.

Would I recommend it? Sure, if you haven't seen it and you're fan of the Mission Impossible films.
