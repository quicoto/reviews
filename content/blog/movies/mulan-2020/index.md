I haven't seen the cartoons and couldn't care less about the story. I wanted to see this movie because of Donnie Yen the man behind the Ip Man movies which portrays an army officer here in Mulan.

I wanted to see the sword fights, which are a little too fake for my taste. There are some good fighting scenes but perhaps I would've preferred more down to earth. Sure, highly skilled individuals but jumping and kicking a spear midair or catching an arrow with your hands...

It's an ok movie, far from a must-watch. I would not watch it again.
