The first movie of the franchise but it's not my favorite. I think Mr. Ford and the direction, in general, do a better job in the 2nd and 3rd movies.

This one presents the character and you immediately feel the thrill for adventure. I'm surprised that rewatching it almost 20 years after its debut and you can still be entertained and no think "it looks old" or "such a fake special effects".

One of the best movies, which repeats in later sequels is at the university. The students are madly in love with Dr. Jones. That woman with the text "love you" in her eyelids is too much ü§£

I totally forgot how the movie ends. With a shot of an immense warehouse where supposedly the US government buries top-secret material. I wonder if it has any relationship to the 2009 TV Show Warehouse 13. The shot and of course concept, are very similar.

All and all, Indiana Jones is a classic and everyone should watch them sooner or later.
