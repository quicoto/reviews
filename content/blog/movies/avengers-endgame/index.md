Amazing production. Great closure to a great franchise.

It not makes me entertained but also brings back memories. I watched this one in Daejon (South Korea) after they released it in theaters. I enjoyed it back then and I enjoyed it again today.

Sad about Iron Man of course but very happy about Captain America.

Thor is too funny, too bad it seems the actor is hanging the hammer. We'll see.

The scene when they all come back have me goosebumps again. The music and the sentence "Avengers, assemble". Truly epic.
