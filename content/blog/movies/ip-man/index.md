One of the best fighting movies of all time, rivaling the classic Bruce Lee himself.

Donnie Yet performs outstanding scenes while portraying the master of the already mentioned Bruce Lee, Grandmaster Ip Man.

The story itself is not bad, even if it seems not entirely accurate. Most of the scenes didn't happen, although the general sense of the movie does portray his life.

It's a must-watch for any martial artist or for those who enjoy fighting scenes. Nothing over the top like Crouching Tiger, everything is (especially the punches) kept real.
