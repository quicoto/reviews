I could not even finish it.

The weird accent from the Bond actor (or at least weird to me).

The main secret (who killed the old man) revealed after 50 min, on a 2-hour movie.

The trailer was fantastic and yet highly inaccurate. They made it look like a comedy (on the trailer), nothing of such. I watched half of the movie and it was a drama, not a comedy. What's going on here?

I felt so bored I had to stop it.
