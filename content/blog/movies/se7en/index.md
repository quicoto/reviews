I think it's the second or third time I've seen this movie.

The good thing is it had been a while since my last watch so it kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.

Both main characters deliver. I love the mood of the film, the photography. Even if, from what I've read, was filmed in Los Angeles and there's not a bit of sun. Plus it rains constantly. Which seems not to be what really goes on in LA.

One of the main characters, portrayed by the one and only Mr. Morgan Freeman is a soon to be retired lieutenant detective. You can clearly see he's tired and eager to retired until this case comes in. Then he's pulled in and wants to see this to the end.

The film has quite some gore, not super explicit, nothing like the SAW movies. But good enough so that your mind will fill the gaps. Which, in my opinion, is better than showing you exactly what you're supposed to imagine.

Brad Pit who was 31 at the time seems to only have aged by a couple of years. It has been twenty-five years!
I like how he portrays the young cocky cop with ideals who believes what he does will bring justice to the world. A complete opposite view from the veteran detective Somerset who presents a more pessimistic view of how the world works.

Recommended movie! Even after all this time.
