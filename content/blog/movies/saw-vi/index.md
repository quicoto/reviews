Not sure why I've binged watched, again, this franchise. I'm done. The first ones were very good.

Maybe it was because Kramer was alive and that was really spooky. Also the games were "fair".

In the latest movies it seems there was no lesson to be taught, only pain and death. Did not like how these movies turned out.
