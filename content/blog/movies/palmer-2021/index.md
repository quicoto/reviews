NSYNC is back, I mean Justin Timberlake.

> An ex-convict strikes up a friendship with a boy from a troubled home.

Not a new story and you gotta know what you're getting into before starting. Predictable outcome, ups, and downs...

I did like Timberlake's performance but above all, the 7 year old Ryder Allen. Outstanding.

I also liked how they touched on the gender topic. You wouldn't have seen this in a movie years ago.

All and all, I enjoyed it. The redemption for the main character, the hard-working attitude cleaning toilets with no complain, and simply trying to do good. I have no shame in admitting my eyes were watery at the very end.
