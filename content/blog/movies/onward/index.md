Chris Pratt and Tom Holland's voices elevate the movie, no doubt.

I like how nerdy it is. Quests, dragons, swords... if you ever played a role playing game (doesn't have to be Dungeons and Dragons) you'll enjoy it even more.

Animation is spot on. I remember how I used to study 3D Max back in the day, it was super complex. I'm truly amazed of what they can acomplish nowadays.
