This is the only horror movie film I've watched more than once (ok this one and others in the franchise).

It's a shame the sequels then spiral out of control and loses the tension of the first one. This one, part I, is not especially bloody. However, I think it transmits the horror very well. You don't need to see a foot being actually severed to feel the anguish. I think this film, the director, did it very well.
