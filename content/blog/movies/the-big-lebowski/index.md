This was one weird movie.

On one side I liked very much the vibes of the dude, he was just concerned about his rug and then the shit hit the fan. He's super chill and went with the flow.

Walter, John Goodman, quite a funny character. Serious PTSD from the war, which is understandable. He should get help, though.

Overall a strange movie. I'm not sure it is any good. Entertained me for a while but wouldn't rewatch.
