I love the Indiana Jones franchise (until this movie, that is). I've rewatched this one a few weeks ago and I enjoyed it very much.

The action, comedy, and drama are just right. The perfect formula. Harrison Ford is fantastic and Sir Thomas Sean Connery is simply excellent.

I couldn't care less about the biblical explanations or references, I'm an atheist but I love how the movie depicts the fight of good against evil. Using a whip!

I bet I can re-watch this in 10 years and will enjoy it again.
