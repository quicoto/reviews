1. Creed ready to create the anti-vampire weapons was epic.
2. Jim fooling Dwight, I mean... c'mon Dwight.
3. I was quite surprised at the end with how Micheal reacted to Pam's drawings. We all know how big of an asshole Roy is as a boyfriend, or perhaps as a human being, but Micheal was excepcionally good here. Without even realising. 
4. The unversity scene was super awkward, Micheal Scott style.
