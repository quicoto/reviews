Oh boy this episode was super embarrasing. Just to think someone (Micheal) could crash a wedding (or any event for tha matter).

Don't you think Jim is losing his chance with Pam again? I can somewhat undestand him, he tried before leaving town and he doesn't think the feelings have changed? Shouldn't Pam take the step now?
