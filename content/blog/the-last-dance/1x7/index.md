Baseball, the whole thing is a little bit surreal. It looks to me he got special treatment to get into Double-A with the White Socks because he was Micheal Jordan.

Yes, they do say he got a .200 average, which is more than other can say but you should not skip steps. Others worked as hard, or more, to get into Baseball (and probably never make it there).

In this episode they show how he's playing with the Bulls again in 98, so I'm curious what was his train of thought to end his retirement and come back to basketball.
