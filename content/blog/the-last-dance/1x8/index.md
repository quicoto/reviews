How good can this guy get? He goes to play baseball for 21 months and he's able to come back and win the NBA Final next year.

Glad to see his comeback was hard, he had to get into "basketball shape" again but still... what a machine.

The dark side in all this, is perhaps the harsh treatment to his teammates. When you think about it, maybe that's one of the best ways to push a professional sports team forward? Being soft would've perhaps not been the recipe for achieving those NBA titles.

What's your take?
