How good can this guy get? He goes to play baseball for 21 months and he's able to come back and win the NBA Final next year. 

Glad to see his comeback was hard, he hard to get into "basketball shape" again but still... what a machine.

The dark side is his perhaps harsh treatment to his teammates. When you think about it, maybe that's one of the best ways to push a team forward. Being soft would've perhaps not been the recipe for achieving NBA titles.

What's your take?
