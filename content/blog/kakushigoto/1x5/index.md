Am I the only one who would like the story of the dead (or not) mother to go a little faster?

Don't get me wrong I'm liking the comedy, sure being a manga artist looks rough. Especially when you have an editor like Tomaruin.

Still, I'm curious to see what happened but more importantly Hime's reaction to discovering his father is a manga artist.
