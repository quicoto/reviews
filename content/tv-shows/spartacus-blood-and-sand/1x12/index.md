Spectacular. From Spartacus' fight against the Roman soldiers to the Crixus range moment, passing by Barca's revelation.

Spartacus has come so far. I remember when he barely could wield a sword. Now can take on trained soldiers. Kicking ass.

Crixus' feelings played a bad hand here. Going berserk against Ashur and condemning Naevia to her death or the mines. Luckily he got away with his life.
