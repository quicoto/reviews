It was ok, nothing really outstanding, they're catching up to the last season events. The death of Andy's father, Robert's addiction...

## Crossovers are the best

It's great to see Dr. Webber make an appearance. He's just the best.

## Travis all-time favorite

This character is funny, honest, thoughtful... it brings lots of balance to the team, he's the most functional perhaps after Warren.

## We need to move on from Andy's story

Now that we know she was abandoned by her family, that her father kept her away because of reasons... I don't think we need to dwell on this much longer. We can all agree her father made a terrible mistake. Even if the mother didn't want anything to do with Andy, why take her aunt, cousin, uncle... away from her? The only problem with the situation is that the mother was still seeing the aunt behind Andy's back, which makes it even more terrible. Just terrible.

With that said, I think we should back on track. Step away from the drama a little bit and start fighting fires again.
