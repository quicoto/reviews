Good! The premise is quite interesting. A woman who is "not suppose" to play chess seems to be a genius. Was it the drugs or is she actually one? I want to believe the latter.

The whole orphanage mood is quite depressing, thank God for the old man in the baseman. Such a depressing life. I was expecting some bullying but thankfully the other, older, girl takes her into her wing.

It was ugly how she treated her after she gave her the pills for the match. Asking for more. Please learn some manners and some respect, especially after she did you a huge favor. There are not many things I hate more than disrespect.

So far, I'm interested. Will be watching the next one.
