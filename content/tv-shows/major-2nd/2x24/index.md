This was uncalled for. The way Hiraku talked to Daigo, screw you, man. Yes, the skill level might've not been equal but didn't have any right to talk to him like that. Especially when you said the freak accident you had wasn't Daigo's fault.

Who are you to shit talk like that?

That's allowed if you're close friends and have a friendly rivalry. You haven't seen each other in ages and that's what you go with? You have a rotten personality.

Maybe they'll fix this sour taste by showing he wanted to encourage Daigo or something. If that's the case, a great way to do it.

I didn't like that at all and destroyed everything in the episode. The attitude of the rest of the team was what I expected, being a little pissed and wanted to grow. That's how it's supposed to be (even if not for all the teammates).

Anyway, we'll see...
