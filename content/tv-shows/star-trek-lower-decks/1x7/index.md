It's still funny, yet IMDB reviewers are giving it a harsh 5.9 out of 10. An underrated show which will probably not get renewed. Those who are rating it so low are probably all hardcore Star Trek fans.

I found "Boim me up" hilarious. Boimler is my favorite character hands down. The whole twist on The Farm, funny!

The dog thing was a little bit of stretch. Funny at first but then they went too far, like flying!? Too much.

For the first half of the episode I thought Mariner was not acting "dumb" but was failing to the pressure of being the first officer. Why would she do that? To not have to say "I don't want a promotion". It's fine to stay in lower decks, someone has to do it. Waste of potential? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
