Both fights were pretty weak. We've seen better, way better.

So Boruto upgraded his justu in just a day, must be just to be a genius. Not even his father could do such feats, and he had huge amounts of energy and guts.

Not much to say about this episode. I like how Sakura stepped in to show her daughter how to get it done. Good to see she's still as powerful. Nothing like her generation.
