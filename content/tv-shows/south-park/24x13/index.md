What a fantastic episode. Content and length-wise, an almost 50-minute pandemic special.

I love it when Randy is the center of the episode, such a character. The episode had everything, police brutality, face diapers, the POTUS, Zoom school classes...

The only thing that it has not been great in the past seasons is how Kenny McCormick has had any lines. No much action from this character and I love the dude. He's great. Stan and Kyle, yeah, they're cool too but they're on the spotlight too much. Not unexpectedly Cartman found a way to cheat the system. The picture in front of the camera is a classic, a classic that actually works.

Not the absolute best South Park episode we've seen but way above average, especially considering the longer format which seems to be a harder job as you need to keep the audience engaged for a longer time.
