Espectacular production.

Disclaimer: I haven't seen the first two seasons. I haven't seen anything from Star Trek other than Lower Decks.

I gave this third season a go after reading a review saying it could potentially appeal to the newcomers. Not just the die-hard fans. So far, it's true. Watching the first episode I did not feel I was missing out on details, I could follow along with the little knowledge I have about the Star Trek universe.

I was immediately surprised by the well-produced episode, almost an hour-long full of CGI that did not look cheap.

The plot is also interesting. I've always found time travel fascinating. Although I'm not sure the time travel topic will show again in the following episodes, I think the show will simply start from here and develop without any more time jumps.

So far, I'm on board.
