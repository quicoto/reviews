Way more average episode than the last one, no doubt. The best part was, of course, the western style cantina with the fighting and standoff scenes. Not super impressive but good enough.

As a newcomer to the Trek world the episode also served me as an introduction to the ship, the characters, and the roles. Which is not a bad thing, I can see how perhaps a seasoned Trekkie might've gotten a little bored.

I find it funny that the chairs on the bridge have no anchoring system, like seatbelts. They end up flying everywhere when they crash or hit something. We've had seatbelts for a long time here, I guess they're too old to be used on a spaceship üòÅ

Looking forward the reunion on the next episode and the plan of attack. What happened, where they're going, and what are they going to do now.
