Good overall, was hoping for more romance towards the end. Yes their relationshop matured a little but not at a pace I would've liked. I guess the director wanted to give more focus to the games and being otaku in general.

I totally ship Nao and the gamer girl. Would love to see a second season where Nao realises she's a girl and develops romantic feelings.

I enjoyed the show, would recommend if you want to have a good time.
