Haru betrayed left and right, what a team. That hurt. Why would they do that in front of the higher ups? It wasn't even funny. Freaking lazy cops dude.

The plot accelerated so much in this episode, which is good. What wasn't good was how short the episode felt. So many unanswered questions we'll have to wait for.

It also hurt that Daisuke was pushing away Haru, to protect him? He was there for you and has shown to be a good cop to his core.
