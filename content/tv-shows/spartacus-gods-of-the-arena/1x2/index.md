Ah so good! How Oenomaus is forced to fight his doctore and how the two friends are put in unescapable experience just to entertain their masters.

It's fantastic how Crixus is evolving, showing his hunger for the arena and beyond. To become a champion. So great to see his transformation, as we only saw him as the almighty in the first season of Spartacus.
