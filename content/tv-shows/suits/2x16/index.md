Espectacular season finale.

Everything in it was great. Louis being Louis with Nigel and slowly regaining Donna's trust.

Harvey against the world, and Jessica.

Mike trying to help and getting beat up for it.

Scottie getting hurt, although that was probably her fault for lying in the first place.

What about Mike and Rachel? He said it! I wasn't sure he would. She forgave him quickly 😏
