I'm not giving it 1 star due to the last 2 minutes.

The whole episode was such a filler non-sense. They explained nothing of that secret order. They explained nothing about these "superpowers" which seem to be pretty weak. Mira could take him down with a single blow...

Should we get over the fact that an adult, pedophile, wanted to marry a high school girl and most of those around them (including her legal guardian) were ok with it?

Let's not waste a second more, next episode, please.
