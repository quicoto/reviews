What did I just watch?

At the beginning, I was laughing out loud. Since I'm a martial art instructor I could never imagine myself doing what the sensei was doing/saying. It was funny.

The movie then turns dark very, very quickly. I don't think it taught much to the main character other than, eye for an eye. Which doesn't seem a very good lesson if you ask me.

Don't waste time watching it.
