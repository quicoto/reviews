I've re-watched this amazing movie for, I don't know, the fifth time?

The fighting scenes are exquisite and the whole idea behind learning martial arts, these are more than simple techniques.

I see myself in Master Ip a little bit. Or at least I want to think I'm walking that path. I try to teach Haidong Gumdo to my students beyond the cutting techniques. I want them to become a better version of themselves through martial art training. Not an easy task, but if it was easy it wouldn't be as rewarding.
