The dark Hanadori’s dark past as a rockstar was funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad for Seri that the girl did not show any more interest and then got the idea that him and Hanadori are trying to be a couple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seri has got a hell of a friend but that friend needs an off-switch 😁&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><rating>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</rating></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Last Dance 1x3]]></title><description><![CDATA[The time jumps start to be a little confusing to me.

I’m not a basketball fan and I don’t know in detail the Bulls or the players timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, episode three has thrilling moments. Some of the plays they show, what Jordan did back then, they left me with the mouth open. The physical prowess and the control of the ball, out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MJ is simply inspiring. It can inspire you in your day to day, or in my personal case as a Haidong Gumdo instructor. He has a basket ball I have a sword. To be able to control an external object as it were part of your body, that takes a lot of work to master.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><rating>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</rating></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai 2x6]]></title><description><![CDATA[Shinogane show she’s truly a good guy.

I loved how they prepared every single detail of the speech, all coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I liked how they helped Miko on the stage it made no sense the vote results were that close. That aside, the episode was good. We had our dose of infuriating scene were they can’t seem to be honest with each other. Back to square one? We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Ishigami is the best. Great character development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><rating>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</rating></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Office 3x16]]></title><description><![CDATA[Oh boy this episode was super embarrasing to watch.

Just to think someone (Micheal) could crash a wedding (or any event for that matter), doing speeches and taking over the priest role 🤦🏻‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t you think Jim is losing his chance with Pam again? I can somewhat undestand him, he tried before leaving town and he doesn’t think the feelings have changed? Shouldn’t Pam take the step now?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><rating>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</rating></item></channel></rss>
