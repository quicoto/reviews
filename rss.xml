I‚Äôm not a basketball fan and I don‚Äôt know in detail the Bulls or the players timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, episode three has thrilling moments. Some of the plays they show, what Jordan did back then, they left me with the mouth open. The physical prowess and the control of the ball, out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MJ is simply inspiring. It can inspire you in your day to day, or in my personal case as a Haidong Gumdo instructor. He has a basket ball I have a sword. To be able to control an external object as it were part of your body, that takes a lot of work to master.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai 2x6]]></title><description><![CDATA[Shinogane show she‚Äôs truly a good guy.

I loved how they prepared every single detail of the speech, all coordinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I liked how they helped Miko on the stage it made no sense the vote results were that close. That aside, the episode was good. We had our dose of infuriating scene were they can‚Äôt seem to be honest with each other. Back to square one? We‚Äôll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Ishigami is the best. Great character development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Office 3x16]]></title><description><![CDATA[Oh boy this episode was super embarrasing to watch.

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt you think Jim is losing his chance with Pam again? I can somewhat undestand him, he tried before leaving town and he doesn‚Äôt think the feelings have changed? Shouldn‚Äôt Pam take the step now?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
