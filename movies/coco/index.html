<p>Reviewing this three years after its release date. I'm very impressed with these animation movies, how far they've come. They look fantastic.</p>
<p>I liked Coco, the movie is charming, quick-paced, and delivers a happy ending. Before watching it they told me it was sad. Well, it touches on life and dead but I think their approach works nicely. It didn't feel sad, especially because there's &quot;life&quot; after dying.</p>
<p>I'm unfamiliar with this Mexican tradition, I hope they made it justice without straying too far from the truth and now we all know a little bit more about it.</p>
<p>The main character is very likable, who hasn't tried to pursue something at some point just to have other people reject the idea just because of their ideas.</p>
<p>Recommended? Yes! It's not a musical, in case you're worried about too much singing. I'm surprised how well the songs work mixing English and Spanish.</p>
