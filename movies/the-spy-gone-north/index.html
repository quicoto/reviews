<p>You know me, I'm deeply interested in Korea. Been there several times, I've studied its culture, its language...</p>
<p>I can't tell if the historic events of the movie are accurate. It's based on a real story so we should be careful with what we read into it.</p>
<p>Regardless of the accuracy, the topic is complicated. The North, the South, the possible reunion, the hunger of a country lead but by a party of madmen who disregard the need of millions.</p>
<p>It's a little bit long, I had to watch it in two sessions but it got me hooked. I couldn't tell what was going to happen, unlike other spy Hollywood-style movies where it's easy to guess the plot.</p>
<p>The acting is good, the photography and placement are also good, they take you there. To that secretive and unknown country, although they show other locations such as Seoul and Beijing.</p>
<p>If you're into spies and you're someone interested in Korea, watch it.</p>
