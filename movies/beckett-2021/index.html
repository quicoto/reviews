<p>The plot starts very intriguingly. How does the protagonist end up in the middle of a kill on sight order. Who is after him? Why?</p>
<p>It's interesting until about halfway there, when the dude gets to the embassy. For some reason, they're also crooks and paid by the mafia to overthrow the current government? I would've liked some more thought into this, maybe it was part of US foreign policy to help that radical group, but simply money? I don't buy it.</p>
<p>Also, the way the whole thing was presented, it was a little bit stretched. Would've Beckett recognized the boy while going back to the US if they would have not tried to kill him? I don't think you would pay much attention to that. The corrupt cop should've just said &quot;yes, they're fine, thanks for asking.&quot; End of story. The dude goes back to the US with his girlfriend's body.</p>
<p>What about the last scene where the dude jumps like 3 floors over a moving vehicle, as if James Bond himself, after being shot in the torso a few seconds before. Not to mention the man was running non-stop for the past few days. Superhuman strength! I guess the power of &quot;doing what's right&quot; gave him the push he needed to complete his mission ðŸ˜‚</p>
