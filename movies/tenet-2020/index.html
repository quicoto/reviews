<p>One of the most confusing movies, yet it kept me at the edge of my seat.</p>
<p>The visual effects are stunning, no idea how they recorded this but looks amazing.</p>
<p>The whole thing almost fries my brain, I've had to go on YouTube to get more answers.</p>
<p>The acting is pretty good but I'm not super convinced about the plot. The future society wants to eradicate the past society because they think that will save the future? I don't know. Wouldn't destroying the past also destroy the future? I guess they know something I don't.</p>
<h2>Recommended?</h2>
<p>Yes! If you're into Christopher Nolan's world (Inception and such). This is on the same lines. Complicated, visually excellent and will leave you thinking for a while</p>
<p>I've always had troubles with time travel movies, I love them but each one seems to explain the concept differently. If you're going to the past it means you already did it? If you did, can you change anything in the future? It's complicated.</p>
