<p>I don't believe it. I have yet to meet a single soul that would voluntarily go to prison. That makes no sense. If you're going to save someone, or because you've made a deal which would've had to do jail time for longer... But for no reason? The dude could've left the group and enjoy the money. I'm sorry but this makes no sense.</p>
<p>The episode was entertaining. Now that we know how they roll the ruse about the fighting was easy to see-through. Maybe too easy? I didn't feel the excitement of the first story with the drugs. They did trick me with the mechanic, but still.</p>
<p>Two out of five because of the major plot hole regarding the prison. 2 years he spent for nothing!</p>
