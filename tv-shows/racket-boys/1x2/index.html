<p>The drama, of course! We've had everything: bullying, suicide, the plot reveals, and a good cliffhanger.</p>
<p>I felt a little bit anxious for the whole bullying, I hope they don't dwell too much into that. Hopefully, they only used it to strengthen the team &quot;we are one&quot; and the appearance of the strict White Wolf. That was cool.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about the coach's kid. He hasn't trained that much and can already beat this guy? I'm not sure. I think he might lose. I feel he needs more training, to be more involved. He has been creating good friendships, not super strong but he's getting there. In the end, he said this was nothing but a means to an end, to get the wifi at home.</p>
