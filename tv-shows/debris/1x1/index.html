<p>The X-files of 2021?</p>
<p>At first, I was very intrigued. Ok, I still am but it was a little bit of a letdown how they solved the case with feelings. I didn't like that part. Found it boring, having to bring the daughter in so she could talk to them. Also, they were alive and came back to consciousness as the mother was freed from his son.</p>
<p>I won't dwell too much on the meaning of this. So far I like we have conspiracies and a bunch of questions to be answered. Will the answer them or will this show fall into the category of those that can't seem to get out of the graves they dug? If the plot or questions are over complex finding a plausible explanation might not be as easy (remember Lost?)</p>
<p>I will look at the next one to see if gets any better.</p>
