<p>So the whole season is going to be him questing to avenge his dead father? Not a bad premise. Alright, let's see how far this rabbit hole goes.</p>
<p>The whole getting into the prison was somewhat believable. The exodus, that was some Mission Impossible shit.</p>
<p>How did the librarian keep a book that a random inmate gave him 25 years ago? Yeah, no. Why?</p>
<p>The thugs at the prison stabbed him? If you stab the person who owns your money, they won't be able to pay you back. I guess it was a calculated stabbing to let him live. Oh wait, they wanted to hang him the following night. What!?</p>
<p>I don't know, this episode was less realistic. Interesting, sure, but wasn't as well thought as the first one.</p>
<p>I'll continue watching, see what they come up with for the next one.</p>
