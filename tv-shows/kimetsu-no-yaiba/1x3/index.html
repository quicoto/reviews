<p>The dude trains all day and writes a blog at night. That's dedication or a sign that he doesn't train hard enough if he has the energy for that.</p>
<p>So, does 1000 cuts with a real heavy sword, nice! Respect. Once he's done the master orders him to do 500 more. I'm starting to like this master more and more ðŸ‘Œ</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, Tajiro has training for 6 months, all day every day. While he did the daemon is hibernating, first time we're told they can do that.</p>
<p>Then after a year, the master tells him he's done with him, nothing will be taught. What?! Ok training all day every day for a year might be 10 years in conventional training (a few hours a week). Still... the master is harsh.</p>
<h2>The cat masked man has appeared</h2>
<p>Such a nice fight! Wooden vs steel. Of course, wood won, because it's not the weapon but the swordsman that counts.</p>
<h2>The small wise girl</h2>
<p>Ok, I like this girl!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Train to death, there's nothing else you can do</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only my students would understand that! ðŸ˜Ž</p>
<h2>Closing words</h2>
<p>Fantastic episode, the fights deserve a 5 out of 5. The last part is a little bit confusing, was he dreaming about the masked swordsman and the wise girl? Was he real? I don't fully get it, hopefully, it will get clarified in the next one.</p>
