<p>I was expecting so much more from this episode. It was rather dull. The fighting scene was poor. I guess it meant as a way to make Boruto more aware of his dad and how rough he had it back then.</p>
<p>Boruto is still too naive and oblivious. I'm surprised they didn't teach him more about the Leaf history or his dad's past (when he was in his current timeline).</p>
<p>I was also expecting a more serious reaction from Jiraiya when seeing the rasengan attack by Buruto. Like, go in full speed serious mode. He just summoned a mid-sized frog. Lost opportunity to show off there.</p>
