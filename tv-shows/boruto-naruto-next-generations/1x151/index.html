<p>Oh man, the music for the new opening is awful.</p>
<p>So the so-wanted card was indeed Sasuke's card. Called it!</p>
<p>Glad we're moving at a good pace now on the main storyline. I hope we don't get sidetracked again, or least not for a while.</p>
<p>I was hoping Sasuke would use the Sharingan on the thug, as it happened back then with Kakashi and Sasuke's brother. Kakashi was trapped in an illusion that was cutting him with swords and knives. That scene was quite powerful. Today's scene, in contrast, was just playing mind games with the thug who was scared of what Sasuke could do instead of doing.</p>
