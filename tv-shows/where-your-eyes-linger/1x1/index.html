<p>What is this?! I found myself without nothing to watch and nothing interesting popped up on Netflix.</p>
<p>Then I remember this site called Viki, which is the holy grail for Korean Dramas.</p>
<p>I browsers by score and found this random thing about highschoolers. Original from Viki, the site itself. That piqued my interest.</p>
<p>The episode is unbelievable short, thus super straightforward compared to any other Korean Drama I've watched. They are usually 50 minutes long. This one, at least the first episode 12 minutes.</p>
<p>From the get-go, I would say this is going to be the classic love triangle but instead of 2 boys liking 1 girl. It's going to be 1 boy being liked for a girl and boy. Not sure, early to say, but some signs are there. It's interesting because I haven't seen any Korean Drama that had relationships other than heterosexual. Interesting, I shall keep watching.</p>
