<p>Blood, desperation, known actors... I never got around to start watching this show. I remember how everyone used to talk about it and I don't know why, never really appealed to me.</p>
<p>Could be the known actors I recognized in this first episode became famous because of lost?</p>
<p>So far the plot seems pretty average. We've seen many movies of stranded people on a desert island. However, there seem to be dinosaurs? Or another weird creature that even though it seems it can move trees, doesn't seem to be able to chew a human body? (the pilot)</p>
<p>It was funny when Jack was recollecting the moment on the plane were he tells the woman next to him &quot;it's going to be fine&quot; and then the plane breaks in half.</p>
