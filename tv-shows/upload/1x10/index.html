<p>Loved it! Ok, the concept for the show is not entirely new or groundbreaking. Black Mirror sort of did it first but I loved the twist, the twist of being able to connect via Virtual Reality with the dead on the cloud. If you consider them &quot;dead&quot;, that it.</p>
<p>It was funny, and surreal, that the companies would of course charge extra for a better-looking set of pants or that you would have bandwidth caps with those living in the cloud servers.</p>
<p>The main character acting is not earth-shattering but that's ok. I think the special effects are rather cool for a tv show.</p>
<p>The only thing is I feel the plot did not advance as much as I wanted. It seems they did not give it enough importance to the fact that he might've been murdered. Not sure how I'd feel if I know I had been killed. I suppose I would want to seek justice.</p>
<p>UPLOAD has been renewed for a second season, looking forward. Well done Amazon.</p>
