<p>Very insightful, I hope it's as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>I had somewhat followed this issue back when it happened. Even in Europe you couldn't help but get news on how the election was going.</p>
<p>I remember waking up the morning (Barcelona time) of the results and while having my oatmeal I went online to check who had won. I didn't believe it either.
That same day I had a meeting in which we had a colleague from the USA, he couldn't believe it either.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of Jeff Daniels since The Newsroom, a very well-rounded actor that delivers here.</p>
<p>I can tell you this was engaging because even though the first episode goes for 1.5 hours it didn't seem long. I thought it was 45 or 50 minutes, then realized it was past midnight.</p>
<p>They don't touch much on the Russia issue, no mention of Cambridge Analytica, or how they turned social media against itself. That part, to me being a software engineer, is even more interesting.</p>
