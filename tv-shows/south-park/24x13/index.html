<p>What a fantastic episode. Content and length-wise, an almost 50-minute pandemic special.</p>
<p>I love it when Randy is the center of the episode, such a character. The episode had everything, police brutality, face diapers, the POTUS, Zoom school classes...</p>
<p>The only thing that it has not been great in the past seasons is how Kenny McCormick has had any lines. No much action from this character and I love the dude. He's great. Stan and Kyle, yeah, they're cool too but they're on the spotlight too much. Not unexpectedly Cartman found a way to cheat the system. The picture in front of the camera is a classic, a classic that actually works.</p>
<p>Not the absolute best South Park episode we've seen but way above average, especially considering the longer format which seems to be a harder job as you need to keep the audience engaged for a longer time.</p>
