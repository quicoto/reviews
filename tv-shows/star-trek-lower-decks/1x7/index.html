<p>It's still funny, yet IMDB reviewers are giving it a harsh 5.9 out of 10. An underrated show which will probably not get renewed. Those who are rating it so low are probably all hardcore Star Trek fans.</p>
<p>I found &quot;Boim me up&quot; hilarious. Boimler is my favorite character hands down. The whole twist on The Farm, funny!</p>
<p>The dog thing was a little bit of stretch. Funny at first but then they went too far, like flying!? Too much.</p>
<p>For the first half of the episode I thought Mariner was not acting &quot;dumb&quot; but was failing to the pressure of being the first officer. Why would she do that? To not have to say &quot;I don't want a promotion&quot;. It's fine to stay in lower decks, someone has to do it. Waste of potential? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.</p>
