<p>So many things going on in this episode. Glad to see their search was successful in finding HQ.</p>
<h2>Admiral</h2>
<p>I think the admiral does a good job at being skeptical, he can't trust them right away. They shouldn't be so surprised he doesn't. He eventually comes around, as we suspected he would.</p>
<h2>Nerd alert</h2>
<p>Love when they start saying sci-fi words, when they got to the HQ and saw all the new tech advancements. They couldn't contain their excitement. Will they upgrade Discovery with some of the new tech?</p>
<h2>For Starfleet</h2>
<p>I found it funny that when they left the officer in the seed ship they departed instantly. No one questioned why isn't she beaming up, just hit the road.</p>
<h2>The burn</h2>
<p>At first I was a little disappointed they knew practically nothing about &quot;the burn&quot; but I guess this will be used as a story vehicle to keep searching for the truth.</p>
<h2>Book is back, baby</h2>
<p>How about the preview? Book is finally back! Long time no see.</p>
