<p>Every episode brings so many things it's hard to be concise in the reviews.</p>
<p>I liked this one better than the last one, the jailbreak was nice. The whole &quot;you got me at the unsanctioned mission&quot; was hilarious. They make such a good team. I like the plot is thickening with Georgiou's flashbacks. The last one was scary but I wasn't fearing for Micheal's life.</p>
<p>You can clearly see how Micheal has now ideals beyond Starfleet, how she's clearly in love with Book and will go to the end of the universe to save him. I feel bad for Saru, he was put in a difficult position. Being the captain or team lead is never easy. He made the right decision demoting Michael.</p>
<p>Can we all appreciate the sweet moment between Stamets and Adira when she explains she can talk to her dead boyfriend? This is Star Trek, anything is possible and I like how he phrased and emphasized.</p>
<p>I'm glad Book is back, I hope he's here to stay. Will he stay?</p>
