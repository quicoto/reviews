<p>This was brutal. Harvey exploded in front of Louis, with valid reasons. Poor Jessica has to deal with the gunslinger, doesn't look easy.</p>
<p>Mike got what he deserved. He slept with Tess knowing she was married (loving her husband or not. Don't do that man. Be a gentleman).</p>
<p>I felt bad for Harold, I could not work a single minute in an environment as toxic as this law firm. I've never been to one but I hope they don't do these verbal exchanges. It's just too much. Harold should've punched Louis' face.</p>
<p>Such a powerful scene when Harvey gets to Louis' office without saying a word and rips the resignation letter in half. No words are exchanged but the message got across. Well done.</p>
