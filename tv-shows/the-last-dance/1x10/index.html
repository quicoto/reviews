<p>It's done. Quite the documentary, out of a movie. Speaking from a viewer who hasn't followed any basketball, I loved it. I knew of Micheal Jordan, I knew Denis Rodman. However the information I got was a vague &quot;there were very good&quot;.</p>
<p>I had never imagined how things played out, how much of a leadership figure MJ was, how much hard work he and the team around him had to put to win all those NBA championships.</p>
<p>The documentary itself was very well done, epic. As I mentioned in past episodes, the only thing which made me a little confused was the time jumps (even if clearly stated). Perhaps if they would've produced in a more linear way it would've been boring? Not sure.</p>
<p>Glad I watched it. Inspiring work ethics from those players that I can take with me.</p>
